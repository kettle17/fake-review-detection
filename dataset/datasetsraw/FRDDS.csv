"Made me cry. made me laugh, made me sad!","This review is for Prince Harry: I loved your book, it made me cry, it made me laugh, but mostly made me very sad. You've been trying so hard for so long to find the TRUTH, but looking in all the wrong places. I can say this Harry because I'm a nobody, average American living in Florida, nearly twice your age and with years of ""Inner Healing"" experience: Harry, you need a SOZO. You are dealing with unresolved trauma that may have even begun in vitro. And Harry, you can be healed once and for all, set free to live your life as God intended. This is not counseling, this is inner healing ministry and you are living in the perfect place, where Bethel Sozo began (see ""bethelsozo.com"") in 1997. Interesting coincidence? The word SOZO is Greek and is used 110 times in the New Testament and it means to ""MAKE WHOLE"", also to save, deliver, heal and preserve. Unresolved Trauma creates walls, divisions and segmentation in your life, that is why parts of your memory just disappear. SOZO uncovers these traumas and other injuries caused by the lies we have believed and replaces them with the TRUTH. There is only one source of truth and only He can set you free and make you ""Complete"". Your Grandmother had a very special relationship with our Creator and her Reign reflects those blessings poured out on the House of Windsor and all of Britain because of that relationship. Was she perfect? no. Did she make mistakes? of course, she was human. But I believe God has spoken and put His arms around Queen Elizabeth ll and said ""job well done, My good and faithful servant"". Her Monarchy is over, but Harry you've just begun and have much to do to fulfill your destiny. I pray that Father God would guide your heart in it's search for Truth, that you may be ""Made Whole"" and available to continue your service to Him. Harry, be so blessed!",5,05/02/2023 03:23,Spare,Books,OR,

Lot Of Hype; No Real Pics Of Keyes,"Am about 2/3rds thru this book and really don't understand either the ""selling"" of Keyes as ""the most ambitious and terrifying serial killer in modern history"", or the praise lauded on the author for her portrayal of his story.  Not to belittle the seriousness of the man's crimes, there is nothing particularly instructive about this book - no greater insight into the predator mindset - or no ""record-setting"" numbers of murders.  And except for what I assume is a partial picture of Keyes on the cover, there are no pictures of him.

No traditional music notation at all in the book,"If you wanted to learn how to play the guitar and be able to pick up any sheet music and play it, this is not the book for you. Look closely at the picture, these are not music notes. they are different numbers and a special system called tab, which is not traditional music. There's no actual traditional music notation in the book at all. You're not going to learn to read music, you are going to learn something called tab. They have some special thing called tab which requires you figuring out all the little numbers on the different lines and trying to marry that to the guitar and chords instead of just using regular music notes. It's a bizarre strange thing. I don't understand the point, because unless you've got the special little tab notation system for every piece of music on the planet, you're going to be limited until you turn around and learn how to read music. I assume after some time you'll be able to automatically figure out all the little lines - how they correspond, but it just seems adding an unnecessarily complicated step instead of just showing the music notes and teaching people how to actually really read music. The book itself is a typical 11x17 folded in half and saddle stitched, decent quality paper. The contents just are not a match for me. There's really nothing in this book, other than it showing the finger positions for different chords, that I'm finding useful. I'll keep looking for another beginner book that teaches basic guitar with real music notation. I should have looked at the photos closer. I just assumed they would have the real music in here along with this tab thing they're using.

a quick shorter version of the movie,"Space Jam: A New Legacy by Ivan Cohen If you're reading this book, you probably already saw the movie. It doesn't matter if you read the book first then watch the movie or vice versa. The Comic was good except for they changed the ending. I feel it should of have the same ending as the movie because it was an emotional moment. The book lost that moment when it removed it. Al G. Rhythm is The Warner Bros Algorithm, and he is stuck in the Serververse and no one even knows he exist. To change his unknown fate, he uses law 13 in the 48 laws of power by appealing to LeBron's James Self-Interest. This quickly fails as Lebron thinks joining Warner is a dumb idea and Al G. Rhythm gets angry and traps Lebron and his son Dom into the digital world and challenges him to a basketball game. Al G. Rhythm uses law 44 in the 48 laws of power to make believe he shares Dom beliefs and values to get him to be on his side of the team. Lebron James and his team with bugs bunny and the Tune Squad are struggling to score points and are losing miserably. It's not until the tune squad makes Lebron James realize law 41 in the 48 laws of power: No one can step into your shoes and be like you. Everyone must shine in their own way. Lola Bunny tells Lebron, ""You've been trying to get these guys to play like you, but no one can do that. It's time to let the Tune Squad do what they're good at."" Lebron responds with, ""I guess I've gotta let you do you. Looney all the way."" and that's it because I don't want to spoil the rest of the story. My favorite quote from the book is ""You got to see every adversity as part of the process. If you're passionate about something, pushing through adversity is how you become great.""

Shelby Tebow is the very first woman to go missing. Soon after, Meredith Dicky and her six year old little girl, Delilah, disappear just a few blocks away from where Shelby was seen last. This brings about a fear to the peaceful little community like none known before. After a long search the cases go cold. Eleven years later Delilah returns!

I did have a vague knowledge that Dr. Moreau created monstrous creatures here they are hybrids. So they are still beings that outsiders would be frightened of but lead lives as humans at the hacienda. I enjoyed getting to know Carlota, Montgomery, and all the characters that lived at the hacienda. We meet her as a young woman in her early teens whose father, Dr. Moreau, has kept her sheltered there in their home but also educated her. She's helping prepare for the visit of Mr. Lizalde, the man who funds her father's research. He's there to see how things are coming along and to bring a  new majordomo. There is a time jump of six years and we meet Mr. Lizalde's son and nephew. They were told to not venture to the hacienda without the older man but do anyway. Montgomery does his best to send them away but Carlota intervenes. After they meet with her father, he encourages Carlota to spend time with Lizalde's son in the hopes of them starting a relationship. But also so he doesn't lose his funding. But they must keep them from seeing the hybrids. Because these visitors have no idea what really happens here.

"Everything looks amazing, however..",First recipe I tried was banh cuon nhan thit lon. I posted the picture of my result and the second one is hers. I have a really good banh cuon recipe already but thought I give this a try. What a freakin’ disaster. I am so annoyed that I wasted my time. The “banh cuon” doesn’t even stick together. Also- cooking at high temperature makes it burn before it can even cook properly.  The batter is so thick that you can’t even swirl your pan and thin it out. And- it’s missing a bit of tapioca powder (this recipe has none). Also- the mushrooms and onions were way too much and the ground pork was not enough. I felt like I was only eating mushrooms and a bit of onion and no protein! FYI. I am Vietnamese and I cook Viet food all the time.

Strong Women and Magic!,"It's not a good time to be a woman in a place where women's lives are controlled by the possibility of being accused of being a witch. It doesn't take much; a disgruntled husband, neighbor, or boss, a jealous co-worker and then the nightmare begins. Josephine is nearing 30, the age where unmarried women must register with the State and begin intrusive monitoring. She has been on the State's radar since her odd mother disappeared 14 years earlier and  assumed to be a witch. Her mother's will makes an unusual request, setting Josephine on a life changing journey. This is where things really get interesting.

Granny D: Walking Across America in My Ninetieth Year,"I can honestly say I'd never heard of Granny D.  Which is surprising, considering the amount of news coverage around her.  I think it was just due to timing; I was not yet old enough to vote when she did her walk, and so wasn't really politically minded. This is not to say this is a political book entirely.  It's a big portion of that, given that her reasoning for going on her trek across America was to raise awareness around campaign finance reform.  But it's also just about the people who helped her along the way, some of her past history (this wasn't her first foray into activism), and finally just the toll of the walk itself. Haddock, or Granny D as she went by during her walk, is an interesting character.  And that reflects through her narration.  She'd have to be, to decide to walk across America at almost age 90.  She's not shy in what she says, I'm guessing when you get to be that age it's probably part of the loss of filter and time.  But she's also exceedingly generous to most she describes; she sees the world as a beautiful place and can usually say at least one positive thing about everyone she is around.  Which I admire. Definitely an interesting book about an interesting lady.  To only hope to be that engaged at her age. Review by M.

Another retelling of X-men history,Kind of expensive for really just two issues plus a widely used reprint of X-men #268.

Good Enough to Re-read,"When Phoebe Walsh moves to Florida for the summer to prepare her late father’s house for sale, she also plans to finish her dissertation. She’s turned her lifelong obsession with true crime into a research topic, analyzing the genre for her thesis. With murders, cons, and others crimes always on her mind, she can be forgiven for being less than trusting or thinking Sam, her next door neighbor who keeps strange hours and has a soundproof garage might just be a serial killer. Actually doing any writing may be a challenge as Phoebe stays busy wrangling her always positive but not always responsible little brother, Connor, reconnecting with her childhood best friend, dealing with her complicated feelings about her father with whom she hadn’t spoken in years, and evaluating Sam’s threat level. Returning to her hometown, though, gives Phoebe a new perspective on her future, her relationships, and the things that truly scare her. I found this book delightful and laughed out loud several times. Phoebe was very relatable to me with her preference for messy buns and leggings. Because I have a PhD, I also empathized with Phoebe’s issues with her advisor and struggling to convey her thoughts on paper. As much as I liked Phoebe, I got so frustrated with her, but I appreciated her character arc. Sam, Connor, and Allison were all great characters, too! Though I love true crime, I don’t love it as much as Phoebe! She does see the world through a suspecting lens and often discusses cases, many familiar to me. Readers should no that no murders are committed during the book. Alicia Thompson provides content warnings at the beginning of the book, and I’d encourage readers to preview those. I enjoyed this so much, I can even imagine rereading it soon. I’d definitely recommend to romance fans.",4,05/09/2022 02:21,Love in the Time of Serial Killers,Books,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AqeskGKJL._SL1600_.jpg

"Wide range of quotes, by author/speaker, but organized poorly","I bought this to replace another quote book that I'd given away when we were moving (and regretted). Big mistakes... both letting go of the other book (that's impossible to find, now) and buying this one. Oh, this is a massive collection of quotes, alphabetized by name... that is, the name of the person who wrote or said whatever-it-is, not by the topic. And, for my purposes, I'm looking for quotes related to specific themes and subjects. I'm also looking for quotes more obscure than those available at quotation websites, online. For my research, the topical index at the back of the book is almost nightmarish. The references aren't complete enough to be sure it's the kind of quote I'm looking for, and the pages I then have to flip through... yikes! This book was massively disappointing within just a few minutes of flipping through it, but - since it looked so impressive - I kept trying to use it. 20 quotes later - none of which I could use for my work - I'm probably donating this book to the local thrift shop.

The start of a great new series!,"I was lucky enough to read an ARC of 'Protection of the Pack', and I absolutely loved it!!  This book is the start of a new series, a spin-off from Heather Harris’ Glimmer of the Other series, which has become one of my top five favorites.  I like the creation of a supernatural world that exists in tandem with the natural world, where slipping through a portal will totally change what you see and what you can do.  I also think it’s a unique twist that using magic depletes your energy, which can only be recharged by spending time in the natural (normal, non-magic) world.   Lucy was unexpectedly turned in to a werewolf, and in short order (and against her choice) took over as Alpha of a large, established pack. She has very little idea of what is expected of her, or how to be an Alpha. This book combines Lucy’s struggles to gain the trust of her pack, with a mystery about who is attacking and killing her pack mates.   The strength of Heather Harris’ books, all of them, are her character development, the relationships between her characters (I wish they were my friends!), and the interesting story lines she comes up with.

Riveting Thriller!,"What is the last book you read that you couldn’t put down? I read Take Your Breath Away by Linwood Barclay over Memorial Day weekend.  I couldn’t put this book down! Six years ago, Andrew Mason was on a fishing trip over the weekend and his wife Brie disappeared.  As the husband, he is the prime suspect, but the police are never able to pin the crime on him.  Andrew changes his last name and attempts to start his life over.  Then a woman that appears to be Brie shows up with groceries at the site of their former home.  As sightings of the woman appear around town, Andrew wonders, has Brie returned?  Where has she been for six years?  How is he going to break the news to his current girlfriend? Take Your Breath away is a fast-paced thriller and I greatly enjoyed the story and the characters.  I did not guess the ending of this one, there were many plausible well developed red herrings.  The book was well written building layer upon layer of the story in a fascinating way.  I loved the visual descriptions such as Brie leaving flour on the floor to look for mice but waking up to find a man shaped footprint in it right before the first scene goes black.  I really wanted to know what happened to Brie and I did get a resolution. Overall, Take Your Breath Away is a riveting thriller.  I highly recommend it!

Mr. Southern was a national hero and is a national literary treasure,"The first banned book I ever read was Terry Southern's ""Red Dirt Marijuana"" in 1967. Not only did that book forever set me against anyone who thinks banning books has any effect on thought, creativity, democracy, or intelligence, but it made me a Terry Southern fan for life. I bought ""Now Did This"" when it went on sale at Amazon and I am having flashbacks to when I scanned every month of Esquire Magazine, Rolling Stone, Playboy, and anything other likely source, religiously, in the wild hope that Mr. Southern's brilliant work would be there.  He, not Hunter Thompson, was the foundation of ""gonzo journalism"" and Terry fine-tuned that art to where no one will ever again come close to his brilliance at illuminating the insanity of our death-spiraling police-state, militarist, fascist culture while making the whole thing seem like a great party gone wild.",5,16/07/2022 15:15,"Now Dig This: The Unspeakable Writings of Terry Southern, 1950-1995",Books,OR,

This duology was, in my opinon, as close to perfect as it gets. It was fun from start to finish. I absolutely loved Abriella. I loved that there was mystery, a bit of a love triangle, and there is very mild spice (not at all graphic so appropriate for older YA readers and engaging enough to be enjoyable for adults).

Values that Matter,"In 10 Prophetic Values for Today, James Levesque has written a powerful book covering what he has witnessed is lacking in believers lives right now. He opened up first about how dark the world is becoming. In December 2020, he received a vision from God about how the earth was covered in darkness and he heard a voice from Heaven and it told him how God is going restore His voice upon the earth. He explained the importance of how God spoke the world into existence. We always have that same power available to us from God. He looked at Paul and how he explained to believers the gift of prophecy and how we all desire to hear from God. It’s imperative to be actively in God’s written word and to living in His presence. The book discussed the power of our words and to watch what we are declaring over our lives. A big scripture to remember is Proverbs 18:21 and this stated that our words are powerful and can bring life and death and a talkative person will suffer the consequences from it. He shared some examples such as if we say we are poor or if we believe that all men are dogs. What we say and focus on and believe determines what will be true. He explained how the devil uses our words against us and how this causes us harm. He opened up about his own declaration he has started with his own family. This stated how we are a leader, head and not the tail, lender, blessed, and how we will make a different in the world. I immensely loved this simple declaration and believed it contains powerful wording and actions to refocus our lives and to transform our lives. He shared how many people will come to him seeking a pastor to help their failing marriage, financial troubles, other issues and he told them to change their words. He has witnessed dramatic changes occur when they focus on the words they are speaking over their lives. I would recommend this life changing book to anyone who is ready to learn about the 10 prophetic values that are about to change your life for the better. I liked how he broke the values down into easy-to-understand language to make it easier for readers. I liked how he explained peace and how we can obtain emotional health. It was shocking to read about all the negative effects happening in the world today: suicide, depression, drugs, and much more. Most of what they are trying to treat is just the symptoms of the issue not the root cause. I thought it was very bold in the way he explained how demons love to torment and how they can be found at the root cause of mental illness. The answer for healing is only discovered in Jesus’s blood. My favorite chapter was on power of words and how we can learn to speak words that matter over our lives and others. The declaration is extremely powerful and I believe this will greatly benefit us.",5,04/12/2022 21:08,10 Prophetic Values for Today,Books,OR,

Unpopular Opinion But Honest,"I didn't know anything about author Maira Kalman. I purchased this book for the recipes of Barbara Scott-Goodman. That said, I still read the book and I didn't like the stories. Some of the stories sounded ungrateful like just a spoiled child's thoughts. Not saying, thank you for things given. Acting like that's just normal to be an ungrateful spoiled kid. I didn't eat cake growing up all the time. If I got a treat I would be grateful. I didn't like the unhappiness that's portrayed in this book. I found the stories to be depressing and not joyful as some others whom have reviewed this. I, however, did like the recipes and making them. That being the reason why I purchased this book, I'm good with it. The reason for the two stars, the recipes, everything else wasn't good. Buyer warning though, more stories than recipes in a very small book. Cake is to be appreciated, especially in this time where some of us, (including myself), find it hard to afford such luxuries. My honest opinion, from someone who bought the book, wasn't given a free copy to review. I bought this awhile ago, just getting around to writing my thoughts because I skipped to the recipes first.

Finding worth and purpose as God guides their lives,"""The Hidden Prince"" is biblical fiction set halfway into the Babylon captivity and is set in Babylon, Media, and Persia. Keren is content assisting Daniel while furthering her education as a scribe. True, she loves her childhood friend, Jared, but her family and position are too humble for him to marry her. Jared cares about her, but when she accidently badly injures him during sword practice, he feels betrayed by her and by God. Now he'll always struggle to do what once came so easily and he's rejected by others as no longer good enough or desirable. So he finds it baffling that God has clearly chosen him and Keren to train and protect Cyrus, the future king that will end the Jewish captivity. The main characters were complex, likable, and reacted realistically to events. Keren struggled with forgiving herself for what she did to Jared, and Jared struggled with bitterness and confusion about why God would allow his injury yet also prevent it from being even worse. As they worked through these issues, Keren taught the future king and Jared healed. When they came together again, they protected Cyrus from a king who wanted to eliminate a boy he considers a threat. Jared and Keren learned to trust in God's love and power even when things confused them. There was no bad language or sex scenes. Overall, I'd highly recommend this exciting and engaging historical novel.

Super cute for spring,"This lightweight pink dress reminds me of that beautiful layered chiffon Chanel dress Nicole Kidman wore at the Academy Awards 20 years ago - if that dress were turned into a more casual look you could wear on a picnic.

The elastic on the top is very strong, so have no fear about anything slipping further than you'd like. The Small fit me perfectly, and my measurements are 34B/C, 25, 36. Very comfy fit and makes me feel like I'm going to a party or a spring wedding. My only note of warning is that it comes very wrinkled from factory creases (and will wrinkle after washings) so have a steamer handy. I used my steamer and every wrinkle came out in 5 minutes. I look forward to spring when I can debut it in warmer weather. It's a great shade of pastel pink that makes my pale skin and blonde hair just shine.",5,16/12/2022 19:21,Women's 2023 Summer Off Shoulder Ruffle Dress Short Sleeve Tie Waist Floral Lace A-Line Mini Sundress,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,OR,

"Pretty cut, but too big","On the upside, the beige color is really nice, and I like the cut of the fluted bottom.

My measurements are 34B/C, 25"" waist, 36"" hip, so based on the size chart I thought it would be just fine. I need to roll the sleeves up or cuff them, and the V-neck completely gapes open.

Top is Great for Petites,"I found this Hanes top to be a little roomier than I anticipated.  I ordered a Medium (my usual size), but it’s a bit loose all over.  The width under the arms is 20.5 inches, which is approximately 41” all around.  I do like that the sleeve length (from neck to sleeve hem) is short (26.5”) which is nice for a petite person like me.  Also, the hem falls near my mid thigh.  I am 5’3” and 120 lbs.  It is made of 60% polyester, 30% cotton, and 10% rayon.  I wear it as an undershirt for layering, and it didn’t feel scratchy or sweaty to me.  The neckline is also roomy. If you want form-fitting, you will need to go one size smaller.  Tall people may find it too short.  The length from back of neck to hem is 25”, and that’s the back length.  The back is 2 inches longer than the front.  I like this top, because it works for a petite person like me.  The price is reasonable, too.

My daughter is a very short 9 year old so I assumed the 9-10 yrs size would give her some room to grow into and be longer in length as the little girl pictured in the advertisement but it fit her just right which means she will grow out of it in a few months or after a few washes (will update in future if the dress does in fact shrink) I personally recommend sizing up to the next size which would be 11-12 yrs I’m my case,5,15/10/2022 18:19,LOCOLOCO KIDS Flower Pattern Girls Mini Daisy Tshirt Dress for Girl's Sundress Fashion Daily Casual Dress 9-15 Years,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kVyogUBXL._SL1600_.jpg

Cheap laces that quickly broke. No warranty. Comfortable hiking shoes.,"Update: The laces are lousy. They started to fray almost immediately. After around 20, the laces snapped apart. They are like water-resistant sneakers with thicker treads. These are not trail running shoes, and they are not hiking boots. They went cheap with the laces. In the first week, I had to use a pry stick twice to untie the very tight knots that get formed. The current price is $54 for size 15 black. For around this price you can find similar shoes from the big brands like Columbia or Merrill that are more stylish. All the models in the marketing photos are wearing shoes from competing brands. This is an unknown brand without any online presence or established reputation. No warranty is provided, so your only protection is the Amazon 30-day return window. The big brands include warranties.

Amazing,"I didn’t expect much.  I’m not typically a slipper person.  I am however, a person with icicle feet in 80° weather.  I am also a person with very bony feet and being barefoot for more than 5 minutes is tremendously painful. Normally I wear flip flops so my heels have something to sink in to but especially in the colder months, my feet are freezing.  I’ve  bought slippers in the past but there just wasn’t enough padding to keep the pain away.  I ordered these kind of on a whim and thought the memory foam was probably a gimmick.  I was so wrong. I will admit that I don’t love the silly emoji face on these slippers but oh man, they are worth feeling like an idiot for.  They are SO comfortable and warm and supportive and soft and and and.  They are everything I have always wanted and have never found.  My indoor flip flops are getting zero attention now and my feet are snuggly and warm and pain free in these ridiculous looking slippers.  I am overjoyed!

It is big enough for an overnight trip meaning you'll probably be able to get 1 extra set of clothes and an ipad.  I have a 16"" laptop which will not fit in the laptop holder.  An ipad or perhaps a 13"" laptop should fit with this.  The wheels work well and you can also slide this bag onto the handle of a full size luggage making the transport much more convenient.",4,29/09/2022 19:12,"Samsonite Underseat Carry-On Spinner with USB Port, Jet Black, One Size",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,OR,

A Different Approach To Powering An Audio To USB-C Earphone Adaptor,"This audio to USB phone plug adaptor takes a slightly different approach to allowing a USB-C power cord to be attached for charging the phone while listening to wired audio programming.  The 3mm audio plug connects at the end of the body of the adaptor creating a linear inline connection from earphones to phone.  To charge the phone simultaneously, a USB-C plug port is located on the side of the adaptor at a 90 degree angle to the adaptor body.  This causes the power cord to stick out at a 90 degree angle also when attached.  This may or may not be awkward depending on how the phone is being held or mounted. The adaptor works well providing normal audio quality and volume and allowing a rapid charge - if the power source is capable of rapid charging.

A new love for my old lens,"I haven't used this lens in about a year. My 16-55 has been glued to my camera but I have just recently been applying skins to my bodies and my lenses so the excitement of a new look had me use this lens again! What a sleeper. I love this lens. Anyway, this is not a lens review. The skin itself is a 10/10. It uses quality 3M adhesive to stick to the lens. The cutout matches all part of the lens perfectly and it fits like a glove. Maybe because this is the 2nd skin that I have applied I must say it felt much easier than applying a skin to my A7iii. That one has a ton of stickers and edges. That one took me about 2 hours. I do not know if I would do that again. Applying it to this lens took 1 hour at the most. I highly recommend this skin and this lens. On a sidenote I shot an outdoor event last night with the 16-55 2.8. Images are tact sharp. It's probably Sony's best APS-C lens. However, doing it over again I should have taken this lens for- more reach, PZ, and OSS.

Excellent light with an over-the-top case,"Out of all the various LED video lights I have, this has become my favorite. First off, the color accuracy is outstanding, and adjusting the output level is very easy. The light seems to be very well made and feels quite solid. The corresponding app on my Android phone works well and offers some additional fine tuning and provides firmware updates for the light. The included power brick and cord are nice and long and the cord is also very ""beefy"". I like the little loop to secure the brick to a light stand to keep if from dangling. This light can also be powered via USB C, but you'll need a pretty strong portable power supply to power the light at full. My power station showed it was outputting 80 watts when the light was at 100% brightness. My power station can provide up to 100 watts via USB C, so I was close to my limit. Perhaps if the fans were running a full speed, the power requirements may go up. The included power brick provides up to 90 watts. The light itself is a 70 watt version. By the way, why did they name this ""60DN"" when it's actually a 70 watt light? A little confusing, I think. The included reflector is an odd, proprietary size and the light requires an adapter to use standard Bowens Mount attachments. Fortunately, right now they are including that adapter free with purchase. I have another even smaller 60 watt light that managed to keep the standard Bowens mount, so I'm not sure why iFootage decided to go this route. But what really stood out about this light is the included case. Talk about a well engineered, over-the-top case! Everything has its place. There's even a couple of Velcro loops at the top of the bag for a small light stand, etc. The only negative to the case is there is no room for additional gear. Speaking of additional gear... I also purchased their V-Mount Battery Grip (https://amzn.to/3jYIsHA) which is extremely handy, assuming you have a V-Mount battery. It's made specifically for this model light, so it fits perfectly. There have been so many times it would be nice to ""run and gun"" with a video light in hand and this accessory works great for just that. Overall, I'm extremely impressed with this iFootage 60DN light. The controls are intuitive and don't have unnecessary and confusing features, like some lights I own. And the case is beyond what the competition offers. I'm kind of a case guy, and this case is a treat.",5,15/02/2023 21:59,"IFOOTAGE 60DN LED Video Light, Ultra Color Accuracy CRI 98/SSI 84, 70W / 12,200 Lux @ 3.3' 12200 Continuous Output Lighting, Supports Mobile Charging, APP Control",Electronics,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-hbFs4FdL._SL1600_.jpg

Great device... when it works,"It is incredibly annoying to get it to turn on, and sometimes it just won't. I frequently have to unplug and plug back in every chord related to the device in hopes it will start working. It is EXTREMELY inconsistent. Plus it needs to be calibrated every single time I turn on the computer. It works great when it works, but the user experience is so frustrating that I couldn't recommend it. IMPORTANT: the HDMI chord also takes up the two other display ports to the sides of it, so it doesn't really work with a 3 monitor set up either (I used a knife to shave one of my display port heads, which BARELY managed to fit next to their ultra-wide headed HDMI).

Remote freezes and navigation buttons stopped working after a few weeks and bad picture quality,"I have an apple tv as well which I hooked up to an alienware oled monitor which came out recently. Compared to the apple tv, the picture quality using chromecast was bad and it was even worse when using my phone to cast it, the quality was TERRIBLE, it made the monitor look like a $100 monitor instead of the latest greatest OLED tech. With the apple tv the quality is fine. After a few weeks of barely using it, the remote light just stayed on permanently and only removing the batteries would make the light go off. I tried the troubleshooting steps recommended, which were to hold down two buttons to repair while removing the batteries, etc.  etc. and the navigation buttons never worked again, although the voice button did work. There is no way to type using your phone if you want. It is just another buggy crappy piece of google hardware. Save yourself the headache and just get an apple tv, you plug it in and it works, that is it, no troubleshooting, no trying to adjust the picture (I hear the latest apple tv has a way to auto adjust the colors using your phone camera even).  Yes, the apple tv is bulkier and more expensive, but what is your time worth? And when it breaks you'll have to get an apple tv anyhow. I've had my apple tv for years and worst that happened was I had to repair my remote a few times in a few years, and maybe reboot my apple tv occasionally.

Works Great for My Needs,"I have a home office desk and have been using a 'stand-up' desk on top of that in order to be able to stand.  For years I just had the monitor and my laptop(With Docking station) on the top portion of the stand-up desk.  I realized the lack of adjustability for the monitor and my laptop which is primarily used for a 2nd screen as I have a standard keyboard and mouse as well. I easily was able to attached this to the 'stand-up' desk'.  I now can have my monitor (27"" Samsung curved) attached and then have my docking station with laptop on the other side. I have read some negatives that the 'laptop' holder may be shaky, which I think if you are NOT using a full size keyboard that connects to your laptop, I would agree.  However, it's not common for me to do this unless I'm away from my desk. Another negative comment reported that their 27"" samsung monitor (Curved) did not fit).  Oddly, I just purchased a 27"" curved samsung monitor and had zero problems mounting it  It is Vesa compatible so it's not clear why that negative review. For my 'use' it works great, at a great price and is quite stable and sturdy. The only thing to keep in mind, and I think most of these mounts would be the same, is that the adjustment of the monitor (or laptop) up or down does require you to use the included tool (hex tool) to loosen/tighten the height.  However, for me, once I found the ideal height it's not clear why one would need to continually adjust.  The rest of the adjustability is quite easy.",5,21/02/2023 20:11,"MOUNTUP Monitor Mount with Laptop Tray, Single Monitor Arm for 13-27 Inch Computer Screen, Laptop Mount for Max 17"" Notebook, Desk Monitor Mount with C-Clamp and Grommet Base, up to 17.6lbs, Black",Electronics,OR,

Works. But Way Too Noisy,"Bought this for a first trip to France. Immediately upon arriving at my residence for the month got everything set up…and almost immediately the converter’s little fan started making this nearly-supersonic whine. Like having a high dog whistle constantly going. Tried to tune it out but then periodically when the converter is on and charging my phone, it’ll emit this weird rising electronic chirp at random. All the time. Finally the only way I could get any sleep or avoid a headache was to put the thing on the floor under the bed to SLIGHTLY muffle the noise enough that I could tune it out and sleep. Thought maybe it was an electrical issue with the place I was staying, but I’ve stayed now in five different places, from Paris to Lyon to Provence, and it happens everywhere. I bought a grounded European adapter (this doesn’t come with a grounded plug btw) and yet it still whines.

Definitely not impressed - have started re-thinking my purchases of this brand!,"I have purchased quite a number of different cables, all of this brand, recently. I had thought that they definitely 'looked' like they were pretty good quality; however, I must admit that this cable, as well as two other (not HDMI) cables, from this manufacturer, have 'felt' very thin... although still nicely fabric covered... still rather 'thin', overall. (I can still deal with that, so long as they work, well).  Another (USB) cable, I have had 'intermittent' issues... and will leave a review on that, separately. This cable has had issues since first plugged in where it will put about a 1"" 'band' down the screen (top to bottom) about 3/4 of the distance across the screen... for about a 1/2 second or so, every hour or two... just watching it and 'blip'.  Occasionally, within just a few seconds, another similar 'blip'. After a few days, it started to get what appears to be like a snowstorm (single pixels it looks like), of randomly placed, and moving (like a snowstorm) 'white dots', throughout the picture.  They do not always appear, and are usually worse after the TV connected to the cable has been turned off for several hours, and then is turned back on. I also noticed that, after about a week, it started to develop some weirdly timed 'horizontal' style dropouts, which move around on the screen, for about half an hour... when the TV is turned back on, again after several hours being turned off. The TV is a newer SAMSUNG 4k HDR TV... and I am using the cable for 1080p (only).  I can plug a different HDMI cable (way 'cheaper') and don't have any problems at all. When I went to try and 'replace' the cable, it seems that Amazon has it set to only allow a 'return' for credit.  This makes me wonder if they are already aware that the cables have these problems and figure that, if someone is upset enough about it to point it out once, then they will likely not be happy with a replacement?  (That may be for some other reason, but it still does make me wonder if that may have anything to do with that). I only actually recall receiving 'one' cable (was supposed to be a two-pack) and, I have been doing so much moving around of the equipment that I am not able to locate the original package... so I will not be sending it back.  I will definitely be considering this before buying any further cables from this particular manufacturer. I am thinking that most of them work, fairly well, most of the time but this has left a bad taste for me. For now, I have just become used to leaving the TV on 'all the time'... and it has seemed to make it so I only see that vertical bar, still about ever hour or so, for a 1/4 second or so.... BLIP... then it works for a while without too much issue... then another BLIP.  Meh, since it is just a bit irritating, and not 'absolutely necessary' that it is always perfect... I will adjust.",2,16/04/2022 11:08,"JSAUX 4K Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Cable 10ft, Mini DP to HDMI Cord Compatible with Surface Pro/Dock/Book, MacBook Air/Pro, iMac, Monitor, HDTV, Laptop, Computer, Projector-Red",Electronics,OR,

"Very easy install, well built piece of networking equipment.  Much easier than punchdowns","This review is for iwillink 24 Port RJ45 Through Coupler 1U Cat6 Patch Panel STP Shielded 19-Inch with Back Bar, Wallmount or Rackmount, Compatible with Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6 Cabling. This is my first product from iwillink and I am very impressed with it.  The patch panel features 24 ports and what I really like about this is there is no need to punchdown your wires.  This is a passthrough RJ45 coupler so you can plug directly into the patch panel with your RJ45 and then use a short patch cable into your networking equipment. I ended up purchasing a 12 pack of 6"" patch cables to make for a clean look going from this patch panel into my network controller. I am very happy with the design and construction of this Patch panel and have been using it for a few months now.  It does not feel cheap and definitely has a good weight to it.  The keystones are gold plated which helps and it supports 10G connections which is much higher than what I have currently.

It is much easier to listen to audio on the headset verses the computer speakers.  The reason I got this headset was to provide better audio to the people listening to me.

When i asked my participants to compare the sound quality from the headset and the webcam speaker, they told me there was very little difference.  So apparently either my webcam has a good speaker and the room doesn't echo, or the audio quality is equal.  But I like the headset for the better sound quality for my listening pleasure.

Well Made USB-A to USB-C Cables,"These are well made cables, capable of connecting a USB-C device to a USB-A device, or vice versa. I will be honest - I got these to use to connect my new phone (USB-C) to a variety of devices that still use the USB-A ports, like my car, my pc, an old laptop, etc.  I have fast chargers, but they all have USB-C ports, and thus these cables would not really work on them. The cables are strong, supple, and are indeed very well constructed.  They plug into and pull out of ports with ease, but are not too loose as to slip out by themselves.  Everything is smooth, there are not ragged edges.  The braided cable is nice, and will not kink even if you try. I took off a star only because they sell these as Fast Charging, but do not give a wattage associated with that charge.  All my other fast charging cables will give a watt indicator (45W, 60W, 100W) as a charging speed - these cables do not, leaving me to guess.  Searching online left me more confused, as there seem to be many different answers to what charging speed QC 3.0 will be, from 18W to 36W to 100W.  One or none of these may be right - I really do not know.  However, since I am not using these cables for fast charging, it is not very vital information for me.

Not Worth The Price,"I bought this a couple of years ago and honestly wasn’t thrilled with it then. I had this name brand for my previous iPad and, overall, loved it. This one, not so much. The problem is that they designed that “pop out” piece for a “pen” and it just ruins the case in my opinion. That whole side of the cover - where the pop off piece removes - the iPad is completely exposed there because the case along that whole edge does not fit tightly to the iPad at all. I took a couple of photos so you can see what I mean. The first two photos are how the case is just lying down or being used normally. The photo with my finger sliding inside the case simply shows that I could easily slide most of my fingers into the gap without stretching the case much at all. I’ve never had an iPad pen so the issue isn’t “wear and tear” as I’ve never used that feature. So although the brand has always been what I consider one of the best, I wouldn’t buy another case with the added “pen holder” feature when my main focus is fully protecting my iPad. (Totally admit that choosing the pen holder design was my mistake when it wasn’t necessary, but I learned).

"Wish it came rolled, but wrinkles steam out fine","The backdrop comes folded, instead of rolled. The fabric is polyester and steams out okay with a handheld steamer. Once flattened out, it's a decent size for behind a streamer's chair, but the product photos definitely make it appear bigger. If you have room to get a larger one, I would suggest it. The green is picked up well enough by Zoom or other webcam software. I found the included spring clips to be fairly worthless.

Fair product with Great customer service - Overall Satisfied,"Purchased to replace the factory power antenna in a 1989 DeVille. Unfortunately, the unit made a terrible clicking/popping noise upon install and it sounded like the gears were stripping. I put an email out to the vendor and they quickly shipped a new one, free of charge. Installed the new unit and same thing, lots of clicking and popping as the antenna travels to the highest and lowest points. I'm not sure if this is by design or if it's truly a problem, but I've been through several iterations of up and down and the antenna is working flawlessly. The included adapters are sub-par but still get the job done. I ended up using Coax connectors with a barrel to make a better antenna connection and am now getting great reception! Overall, I'm happy with this because of the fair price and great customer service. Not sure how long it will last, but I'll update my review if I have any issues. If it keeps on working, I can deal with a little noise!",5,13/07/2022 15:41,"Harmony Audio 44PW22 Bundle Compatible with 1988-1998 Cadillac DeVille Fully Automatic 12 Volt Replacement Power Antenna 31"" Mast and ANTEXT12 12"" Antenna Extension Cable",Electronics,OR,
Great quality! Beautiful designs! Super Kawaii!!!,Great pack of stickers! This came with so many different art styles color variations and designs with no duplicates! They range anywhere from dark to adorable and cute to colorful and vibrant to more artsy watercolor or abstract literally something for everybody! I'm a huge lover of the cute little creatures and they're slightly unique so you don't see as many options as you do for like cats or dogs so I  was super excited to get these even my husband thought a lot of them were cool and stole some from me! I purchased sets of stickers on Amazon before that came in quantities like this but weren't very high quality. They were almost like they were printed on basic paper or card stock and just didn't seem like very good quality. These aren't super amazing shiny expensive stickers but they're much higher quality than those and seem very sturdy and durable! Definitely impressed and they definitely exceeded my expectations. I would order these again in a heartbeat!

I like that it is also water resistant meaning that I can take it out in the rain without worry and there are no concerns with me sweating on it changing the song or volume while workout out.

Great Sound - 1st Class Noise Cancelling,"First a side note. Do NOT order this item for overnight delivery. It is a password protected delivery which means that someone will be at your door at 4:00 AM asking for the magic incantation. I have the comparable Sony earbuds so I knew what to expect. Others will have to contend with micro-printed docs on 5 lb paper and a weird wordless diagram which requires a translation from pantomime to one's native language. HOWEVER, the Sony website has ample documentation in a readable format. Also, you need the Sony headphone app to fine tune the setup. I have acute PTSD, a consequence of gun violence. My building is undergoing major construction in th4e form of concrete restoration. I suspect that, for most people, the noise from the machines is a mere inconvenience. For me that is not the case. It's a pile driver inside my head. My earbuds were doing the job (these products have the best noise-cancelling of any device I have tried). However, they have limited battery life. The headphones solve that problem. I CANNOT HEAR A SOUND FROM THE CONSTRUCTION. Moreover, I have modest hearing loss in one ear. Hearing aids balance things out and the headphone can be worn over the aids. I have a large music collection (mostly jazz and classical) ripped losslessly (flac) to large USB drives. The drives are attached to an Nvidia Shield Pro which is an Android TV device. Bluetooth paired right up, has decent range (not requiring LOS) and connects via LDAC (which is what you want for the best quality). I then use Kodi for playback of music and movies. On the left side is an on-off button and another button that can be programmed via the app. On the right, the side of the speaker is actually a mouse pad which allows you to control both volume and your player (Kodi is imperfect in that regard but it works fine with the app on my phone). The music is flat AS IT SHOULD BE.  Competing devices seem to be made for the average 16-year-old, artificially pumping up the bass. If unnatural noise is what you want, there are plenty of IOS and Android equalizer apps. In any event Mr. Mozart sounds like he should. Most jazz includes a bass that comes through exactly as it would in a live performance. Well, not exactly because we experience bass physically as well as through hearing. One final note. These things are big. I have an average-sized head (something my former employees would disagree with). The earpieces are not extended at all and the thing is a bit bigger than my headspace. Also, I wish that they were just a tad lighter. So, in the final analysis, these offer excellent sound reproduction that is accurate, rich and natural. The controls (which include a mouse pad on the right speaker) allow you to control your device and volume. The noise cancellation could not be better. There are no compromises making this a reasonable value.",5,21/02/2023 15:56,"Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Premium Noise Canceling Overhead Headphones with Mic for Phone-Call and Alexa Voice Control, Midnight Blue WH1000XM4",Electronics,OR,

Unfortunately, it isn't quite as nice as I'd hoped. I'll get right to the point - this is not as sturdy a tray as it should be. The legs are thin and are susceptible to breaking if the tray is dropped or mishandled. It is not going to simply collapse under its own weight, and it is made well enough for light duty, but it is not something on which I would rely. Otherwise, this is an attractive tray. It is large enough to handle a dinner plate with some room to spare and it is natural colored so it looks nice. The legs are attached well and they to not swing loosely.

Stunning Dinner Plates,"First off, I will say we have quite a few sets of plates that we use depending on if it is everyday use, social gatherings, or special dinners. These are some of the most stunning I have seen, and had the pleasure to use. The branch design on the plates is superbly done with the 2 tone metallic paint that was used. The texture is also slightly raised which is a very nice touch. I ran them though the dishwasher before first use, and there were no issues. I know the description was slightly confusing, since in one section it said dishwasher safe, and in the product listing hand wash only. They are scratch resistant as stated, which is a plus. I have had plates in the past that said scratch resistant, and got marked up after the first use.

I found this Salad Spinner did an amazing job at drying my greens and it was a lot of fun to use too! But, when it came to chopping everything, it wasn’t the greatest. The first time I gave it a go with chopping, the blade got stuck in the firm spine part of the romaine leaf which meant nothing was getting chopped. Before I realized this, I gave the pulley a firm tug while holding onto the container, and everything went flying—the bowl and greens were on my floor. I tried it again but this time I added fewer pieces and ripped the romaine into smaller sections, and this worked much better and the chopper actually worked as it should. I then added some extra lettuce to the bowl to make a larger salad, and the chopper started acting finicky again just spinning the greens around without chopping anything. It doesn’t seem to handle an average amount of volume very well, at least for romaine. Iceberg or Butter lettuce might perform better?? I gave up trying to process my romaine in here and opted to just rip it into tiny pieces by hand, which actually seemed faster than trying to get this work efficiently. I do recommend this for drying your greens as it worked wonderfully for that, but chopping is another story. I will try it again with a different type of lettuce just to see what happens.",3,13/06/2022 15:24,"Chef'n Salad Chopper and Spinner, 9.6 inches, Green",Home_and_Kitchen,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716gsvZPOnL._SL1600_.jpg

So pretty,"I bought these for my sister who recently had a baby.  She plans to make her own baby food and needed some containers.  These are a very good option,  because the lids are nice and tight without any leaks.  The size is perfect for a couple of days of baby food and it's very convenient that they can be stacked on top of each other for easy storage.  Since they are glass, we don't have to worry about weird chemicals leeching out into the food.  I really like the lovely diamond pattern on the outside.  It's pretty,  but it's more than just decorative.  It also gives you some texture so you can get a better grip on it.

"Great for camping, but this is an excellent everyday fan","This is currently sitting on top of a bookshelf and it provides really good circulation for a medium room on medium with the oscillation on.

Impressed,"I do use apple slicers for apples…mostly. But I also use them to mark where to cut evenly on a pie. Push it part way in and you have a guide for evenly spaced slices. I wanted a guide for 10 slices and that is why I purchased this. But this is probably the best apple slicer I have purchased ever. The core part is a bit proud of the frame, so it goes all the way through the apple. Normally I need to cut off the bottom before slicing.

Best saucepan thus far.  Well thought through design.,"Absolutely love the new saucepan.  We started buying hard anodized pans to minimize the scratching on the surface, even though we use wooden utensils.  And I love the design of this one better than another brand we just bought:  taller sides and hence less oil splattering around the stove area, great for cooking, stir fries and stew, rubber beneath both handles for great grip, the handle is elevated that it isn’t close to the burner and hence hardly any heat felt.  Survived dishwasher clean too.  One of the best sauce pan, and it it relatively light too, which is huge bonus for arthritic hands and for elderlies in mind.",5,07/06/2022 03:06,"Rachael Ray Cook + Create Hard Anodized Nonstick Cookware/Pots and Pan Set, 10 Piece - Black",Home_and_Kitchen,OR,

What a wonderful pour over set up it is.,"This is an insanely pretty coffee maker, and very functional too. I didn't actually think it was anything more than just the stand with the wooden stuff, because I didn't look too hard at it when ordering it for review. Arriving in a big box kinda surprised me. It comes with a nice carrying case, foam inserts so it doesn't move around in transport and fits snuggly into it. Stand made of metal and wood, dripper holder made of wood, as well as a dripper and carafe made of smoked glass, with a lid of rubber and glass. This is very well built and sturdy, I think this will last you a lifetime if you never break it. I own a Chemex Pour Over, and I think this is prettier than it. But let me go into more about it. The filters are standard cone filters, Hario V60 Filters I think are intended, but Melitta cone filters you can get from any grocery store works well. Speaking off, it actually comes with some unbleached filters, a little small of filters, but works well for individual cups, maybe up to 2 if you do multiple pours instead of bigger but fewer pours. So filter wise, pretty cheap to run this over a Chemex, and good results. If you're the type who likes making individual to maybe coffee for up to 3 people, this works well. You could get bigger filters, and the dripper will accommodate them to make more.  Carafe seemingly holds about 750ml or so, markings up to 500ml. I didn't fill it all the way up, so I think 500ml is about as much as you should brew if you plan to use the lid. It also is because due to it being a V60 style of brewer, I don't believe it's as good as a Chemex or other makers for larger brews, but it could do them if you want to. I really love this maker, I've only just got it, but it's made great coffee. If anything happens, I will update the review as needed, but I think this will last as long as my Chemex does if not longer. It seems like well made glass, wood, and metal. As long as you never drop it, it should keep going. If you bought a setup like this from Hario, it would run you $80 or more, this is a steal in my opinion for something of this quality. It looks vintage and classy, even on a coffee table not in use, it looks fantastic. This will make a wonderful addition to my coffee bar, and likely a commonly used one.",5,13/05/2022 19:39,"SOTECH Pour Over Coffee Station Dripper Stand Coffee Filter Wooden Filter Holder Glass Server with Paper Coffee Filters, Coffee Maker Stand Set for Coffee Tea and Saffron",Home_and_Kitchen,OR,

It was okay....,"A grumpy neighbor turns out to be an alien. The girl next door finds out his secret because she sees something she shouldn't. Both of their lives are at risk. They have to overcome the current danger and hurt from their pasts to be able to be together. The story idea was cute. The book wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. There were a few things that just didn't make sense. I don't understand why the alien would get involved at all with the matter at the end of the book. The way it was resolved doesn't make sense either. The girl next door has something she said she doesn't have earlier in the book.  There was absolutely no relationship building. The alien is forgiven for being a jerk without having to work for it at all. There is a lot of repetitive internal dialogue. It felt like the point of view changed at one point from alternating from the alien to the girl next door to third person. There were also editing mistakes. There were a few punctuation errors, wording mistakes and issues with the story. At one point she puts on a shirt and then a couple paragraphs later she was naked and never put on her shirt.

Please Start Trusting Ypour Readers Again - Enough With the Info Dumps!,"Oh Douglas, Douglas. We've had this conversation before. Info dumps are BAD writing technique. You've been on a somewhat steady stream of inflicting more and more info dumps on your readers, and reading Portals tells me you're just gonna keep heading down that path, if it sells books. It's a shame, really, because Portals has absolutely fascinating premises. In that area, it's five stars. But even the action scenes are rife with info dumping. Create a world and let the reader figure it out from the clues, don't just flat out explain why everything is the way it is. It's as if the info dumps exist to explain the twists and turns of the plot (which are, as always, good twists and turns.) But you don't need to feel the constant necessity to explain the twists and turns. Trust the reader to accept them, because you've earned that trust. Sure, I, as a reader, if I encounter a twist or turn that feels odd or illogical, will wonder why the author went that way. But I'd rather have the wondering answered not by just telling me but slowly and surely painting a picture that enables me as the reader to suss it out for myself. Challenge me. Info dumps take that challenge away from the reader. Show more respect for the intellectual capacity of your readers! Paint subtly and cleverly and the serious reader will thank you for not giving everything away. I understand the desire to explain, to do info dumps. I, myself, and quite guilty of being overly verbacious and  not succinct, when writing emails, letters, documents, etc., and writing in a manner to make sure I've covered every little point in every possible way so there's no chance of a misunderstaning. I know where the impulse comes from. Pedagogues tend to think like that. Fiction authors shouldn't have to do that. Your stories will provide plenty of pedagogy (especially in the afterwards) just as they are, without having to ""'splain it to me, Lucy."" Give it a shot. You used to trust your readers at least a bit more.",3,17/11/2022 22:05,Portals,Kindle_Store,OR,

A Beautifully Written Collection of Poetry,"""I am young enough, To know nothing, And desire more.   Yet I am old enough, To know all I need, And realize what I have lost."" This was a beautifully written collection of poetry, allowing the reader a glimpse into the heartache, triumph, bravery and despair that the author, Michelle Sarasin, has experienced. My personal favourite pieces are 'Edge of Darkness', 'Shadows', 'Despair' and 'Shadows of Love'. My motherly heart was broken by 'Without Warning'.

Riveting Suspense and Second Chance at Love Story,"Everly Honor is an unexpectedly resourceful heroine and courageous bodyguard. When former beau Sawyer Blackwood hires her for protection for himself and his niece Layla, neither of them has any idea what she is actually getting herself into. Sawyer is keeping secrets about why he is being targeted and his secrets may lead to more danger for himself and his niece as well as for Everly. This is the second book in the Honor Protection Series but it can definitely be read as a standalone. With a quick pace and non-stop action, the plot was engrossing and tightly written. The characters were relatable and flawed humans which made them realistic and believable. I enjoyed getting to know each character, especially the strong female protagonist Everly. Her ability to think on her feet during difficult challenges was amazing! I also enjoyed the developing relationship between Sawyer and Everly, a romance that was kept below the surface of the main plot but was definitely present. This is a quick read that is absorbing and entertaining as well as well developed with just enough red herrings to keep me guessing. Fans of Love Inspired Suspense will enjoy the inspirational aspects of the two main characters testing their faith and finding each other as they rediscover faith in God.

Dated,Listening to a CD of this book was like watching a 1930s movie.  The dialogue is dated.  What would pass as witty cool dialogue for one generation is boring 4 decades later.

"Every page, a delight","Hana Videen's 'Wordhord' got my attention immediately. She tells the long story of the linguistic patterns evolving from barely discernable Middle English (Chaucer) to undiscernible Old English (Beowulf). If you're like me wrestling with the mental pronunciation of these strange words, then Videen assuredly helps clear it up. It's a must-read for the deep diver of 'Dark Age' Britain and generally the lingua franca of North Sea peoples. It's a rich look into the 1500-1000-year-old words we use every day. It's Videen's use of phonetics from runes through the modern alphabet that I can roll around under my breath that brings to clarity the Old English linguistic anchor in current English. Language is a hallmark of our species — so much so that until the mid-16th century the capacity for language was the key difference between us and animals, between humans and the animals that God placed under Adam's authority. Language and the 'collection' of words, these words tell a story, delineated medieval social class. More valuable than gold which a low-brow thief might possess, a large collection of words, one's 'wordhord', ones vocabulary separated the high status and educated from the masses. Language has always created intellectual constructs in time. The word concept example of ""Nature"" is unknown, our modern understanding meaningless in OE & ME. Nature is not God created 'mann'. 'Not man' was scary theme, Beowulf's thinking but non-speaking Grendal, raw, unknown, and untouched by God's care keeper humans. The uncontested mission of 'Mann"" was to submit non-man to man control and God's good. When everyone, everywhere agrees in the truth of daemons and ghosts, what does every mind conjure in daily routine? Such was the universe of thought until the mid-16th century. It's 180° from the 19th-century origins of our 'nature' understanding. In this world lit by fire, candles represent another ubiquitous concept of light and darkness and similar to the Innuit language of many words to describe snow. 'Sea candles', a term that I've seen in ancient maritime contexts and experienced only poetically as 'candles' caught my attention. The bright reflections from the rising and setting sun and moonlight upon rippling water create a scene like thousands of candles on the water. The sun of course was logically the big candle and so known in the wordhord. Candlelight language is slipping from modern word imagery. First, the otherwise unintelligible spelling is unchanged or slightly changed as in an accent, in modern pronunciation. Smith is ""smith."" Corn is 'corn'. A child is ""child"" but, in symbolically ancient spellings and runes. Second, the phonetics of predecessor runes flow into understandable English words with many of the same relative meanings. The 'thorn', g, p , f - rune characters most especially. Third, Germanic and Scandinavian origins in Old English suggest a 'Mare North Sea' lingua franca that looks suspiciously akin to Romance languages formed around the Mediterranean in the same period. Fourth, the book is an immense help in sound picturing the strange spellings and characters in my mind when I read the period history. Fifth, as a student of Latin and Greek, I had a mental image that the two perhaps contributed more to English than Old English and Nordic/Germanic root. I was wrong. English is thoroughly rooted in Dark Age Old English. Videen's narrative technique, humor, and use of the word-hoard in context and at the chapter's end become a mini-Old English learning lesson. Fascinating, reasonably short read. Well worth it. I followed this read with CS Lewis's Oxford-don scholarship in ""The Discarded Image"" to comprehend more fully the extent and limits of the medieval mind. The pair make a rather complete set.",5,15/05/2022 04:24,The Wordhord: Daily Life in Old English,Kindle_Store,OR,

“It matters not how it seems...,"“It matters not how it seems. All that matters is what is, and I will simply have to deal with whatever that happens to be.” ~ The Artful Dodger (Jack Dawkins) ‘Oliver Twist’, Charles Dickens Oliver and Jack, of ‘At Lodgings in Lyme’ by Jackie North, flee London, terrified of being caught and hanged. The weather is as miserable as they feel. Finally, Oliver tells Jack they are headed to Lyme Regis, where his family was from, hoping there is someone who can help them. Jack picks the pocket of a wealthy man. With this money, they get food and a roof over their head. The next day, they take a coach to Lyme Regis. Oliver has noticed that Jack isn't himself, but when he asks, Jack makes some excuse but admits he has a horrible headache. When he then throws up on the coach, Oliver realizes the seriousness of his illness. As the coach continues, Jack gets worse. When they stop for a break, they find that the coach doesn't go to Lyme Regis, but the coach driver agrees to stop at the point nearby, meaning they still have a distance to walk, in the torrential rain. By now, Jack is so sick that Oliver practically has to carry him. Oliver needs to find shelter for them, and soon! They come upon a grand house and knock on the door. The butler answers. He is wary of them but calls Mrs. Heyland, who runs the household. Jack explains their shabby appearance by saying he used to be Oliver's manservant but that Oliver has lost his fortune and can no longer pay him. She's skeptical, but Oliver works his charm on her and agrees that it's her ""Christian Duty"" not to turn them away. Jack is put to bed to recover. To pay for Jack's doctor bills, Oliver finds work gutting fish. While there, they enjoy a short respite from the trouble that always seems to follow them. When Jack's condition improves, he works with Oliver. All seems well until Jack is accused of stealing books. Unwilling to be separated, Oliver insists that he is guilty too. The authorities arrest both of them, but instead of going to jail to await trial, they take them to the Axminster workhouse. ‘At Lodging in Lyme’ is the second book in the ‘Oliver & Jack’ series. It was good to see Oliver and Jack get some peace providing them time to explore their relationship further. In other ways, it made it even harder when that peace was so cruelly taken away. Thanks, Jackie. I’m looking forward to the next book in the series.

Ambivalent.,"My feelings about James Patterson have been ambivalent for some time now. It began when I was listening to an audiobook based on one of his Alex Cross novels that I had enjoyed over the years. Hours later, approaching home and the end of the story, I am horrified to discover that in order to find out what happened to his family members in danger, I would have to wait until the publication of the next book in the series to find out. Other books in the series had been self contained and wound up within a single volume. Not so this one. I felt so ripped off, I never went back. However, temptation struck with the publication of the book Patterson co-wrote with Bill Clinton who I felt could probably provide some political detail and some realism to the plot so I grabbed a copy and enjoyed it. Frankly, one of the attractions to this book was to read about how Patterson has become some a publishing juggernaut. Some of his approaches I have criticized - the use of co-authors, most people never heard of to construct books based on his outlines then slapping his trademark worthy name on them to generate sales. (All the co-writers are praised as his favorites in here, but I note there is no mention of the comparative revenue split between the ""master"" and his co-writers.) I have also criticized his middle school comic series started in 2012, evidently a rip off of the great success of the ""Wimpy Kid"" series started in 2007. When Bill O'Reilly produced his killing series and celebrity family works starting in 2011, along comes Patterson with is own ""True Crime"" series in 2018 and his celebrity tomes like ""Lennon"" in 2020. So, credit to the man for his sensitivity to what sells, or condemnation as a copy cat who will slap his name on anything he thinks will sell? I do need to give a tip of the hat to Jim for his support of bookstores, libraries and reading programs for kids. All items dear to my heart so I appreciate the work and funds he and Sue have provided. This book is written in his ""tidbit"" sized, 2 page chapters, evidently for those of us with a short attention span so it goes down easy. His comments on his life and his business dealings were interesting enough to warrant the read and he is certainly an author I would enjoy sitting down with and chatting over a beer. Still, ambivalent sums up my feelings pretty well.",4,26/07/2022 17:01,James Patterson by James Patterson: The Stories of My Life,Kindle_Store,OR,
Kept me riveted although hard to read.,"Well, this certainly kept me riveted although hard to read. The female character is kidnapped, raped and held prisoner for a year until she escapes. The book deals with her horrific time with the kidnapper as well as the fallout with family, friends, society and simple learning to deal with what's left of normal life for her. I'd pretty wrenching and graphic although I know there are books out there that would make this seem tame, but the tension and horror were plenty for me. I don't know how realistic the heroine's self-deprecating and ironic sense of humor was given what she went through, but I enjoyed her inner voice. I will definitely check out another Chevy Stevens.

"Really, really dislike the hero","If I thought my 1-star review would hurt Jennifer Peel's rating on this one, I wouldn't write it, since I like when authors write in new genres, and I like her! Since this book's ratings will stay at about 4.5, I feel OK about saying that I COULD NOT STAND this hero. SO BAD.  (mild spoilers): Rowan is ridiculously horrible, with no real justification. He knows he needs an heir, he tells her he won't force her and that someday she will ""beg"" for his attentions, and then he is inexplicably horrible. Refuses to show her respect in front of his people, determined to ""break"" her (why?? how does he think this will help him get an heir??), refuses to give her proper clothing and then when her death is imminent is somehow furious that she doesn't immediately put on the clothing he ordered, is shocked that she has been abused by his mom (though apparently he was watching the whole time?), and is a complete jealous creep when any man shows her kindness. By the end of his unexplained (or really dumbly explained) awfulness, I felt sick at the idea that she might ever like him. In fact, when he says ""I'm unworthy of you"" suddenly I had the hope that she was actually meant for Merek! No such luck, at least so far. A few other things that were hard to swallow: she's so desperate to have a name, he finally says, ""you can choose your own name!"" and then she just....doesn't seem to care about it enough to do it. She's supposedly strong, but the book is full of gratuitous examples of her failing, physically. Just a LITTLE success in this area would have made her a much stronger character.

The Rowan/Aelin relationship is extremely Twilightish and as long as you can forget he’s several hundred years old and she’s a teenager, it’s fine, but once you remember the age difference (and it’s hard to forget since the book likes to remind you) it’s a bit creepy. The ending, as usual was excellent. The author certainly knows how to write a good book ending. Some things were tied up nicely and other things were opened up or continued for the next three books. I recommend Queen of Shadows to anyone who enjoys the Throne of Glass series.",4,16/03/2023 15:56,Queen of Shadows (Throne of Glass Book 4),Kindle_Store,OR,
Review of this book.,Another heart warming story.  The drama was over the top. The ending was so exciting that I was on the edge of my seat. I could not read fast enough to see if they were going to get out of this alive. The suspense was heart pounding. An excellent book. Well worth reading.

Good mystery. I would recommend,"In 2001, siblings Caryn Peeke and her little brother Lloyd are playing on the playground at Moryd-oer Primary School. Soon after, Lloyd goes missing. Caryn was only ten at the time but her parents blamed her for Lloyd's disappearance. She was sent to live with her grandmother and never had contact with them again. Twenty years have passed. Now Caryn is a physician in another city. She has started receiving notes from someone claiming to know where her brother is and to come back home. Caryn arrives back in town and soon her brother's body is discovered. Who is responsible for his death? Caryn may be in danger if she stays in town. This is my first book by this author.

"3.5 stars - Entertaining, but not as good as the first book in the series","This book is a follow-up to The Sorority Murder, the first book featuring former U.S. Marshal Regan Merritt, but it would also work well as a standalone. I loved The Sorority Murder, in part because Regan is such a likable character. She was devastated by the murder of her young son, but is trying to get past that tragedy. In Don't Open the Door, there is new information about the death of her son. She travels back to Virginia to learn more, and ends up having to deal with her ex-husband who is definitely hiding something, but could he be a murderer? The plot of this book is overly complicated and parts of the story move slowly. Even though I still like Regan, this story didn't hold my interest the way the first book did. I liked the dramatic showdown between Regan and a killer near the end and I like the way the story ended. Even though I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first one, I really hope there is a third book in this series so we can see how Regan will live the next chapter in her life.

"Might be Tilly's first catering job, but she's no stranger to helping the police chief out...","At their very first catering gig, of course there's gonna be a dead body. But true to style, Tilly rocked this investigation too and Fiona helped as she could. I got such a kick out of how Linda was able to tame the grouchy chef and actually got to see a nicer version of him. I bet Tilly was worried he'd want her to work for him, but I know Linda's loyal to a fault to Tilly and especially her sweet Unkie. I hadn't been completely sure of the killer, but it was really cool how Barney gathered everyone in true Columbo fashion for the showdown (I could honestly picture Columbo doing this!) and drew things out just for a bit of drama, lol. He's such an awesome police chief and always appreciates Tilly's help a lot. Maybe it's because he's Unkie's best friend but I bet he'd think she was helpful regardless since he's just a nice and fair lawman. We got just a small taste of what's coming in the next book. It'll be interesting to see how Tilly's parents are when she opens her bakery. I hope they're helpful when they visit and nice like I'm sure Tilly's hoping!

This is more of a thriller/mystery.  I loved the story overall, but did feel like there were several holes.  There was all this build with the grandfather and the other family but we don't see any interaction there at the end. There was so much build and so much hype around the company that the ending felt anticlimactic.  Also, the ending with Owen just felt too open-ended...I didn't love that part.  I did love how important family was and central to all of the characters.  This was a great page-turner for me Content: Nothing descriptive.

Another Chance to Travel in Time Before Your Coffee Gets Cold,"I enjoyed the first book in this series by Toshikazu Kawaguchi so much that I immediately grabbed the second, ""Tales from the Cafe.""  The setting is an out-of-the-way cafe in Tokyo where people brave enough to sit in a particular chair and to drink a cup of coffee that must be poured by a woman member of the Tokita family only when the mysterious ""woman in white"" gets up once a day to go the bathroom,can visit the past, or even the future. The rules from Book 1, ""Before Your Coffee Gets Cold,"" still apply. I recommend that readers tackle the books in order, because some action in Book 2 turns out to relate to events or people in Book 1. For example, readers will find out how the ""woman in white"" from Book 1 became a ghost.  Will she ever have a chance to leave her ""permanent"" seat in the cafe?  One prime rule about the time travel is that the short trip will not change anything from the past.  If a person is dead today, for example, nothing a traveler can do in the past will change that. I love the characters for their sensitivity, their good heartedness and that they are willing to risk becoming a ghost if they do not finish their coffee before it gets cold. In this installment, four people take the plunge and emerge with a new outlook on life.

"Worst of the series, hoping for better Volume 4","Loved the first two volumes, but this was unfortunately the worst of the three. It sets up cool ideas but just can't deliver on anything. It seems clear that the movie 'The Batman' is highly influenced by this Batman universe (Andy Serkis mentioned he based his character on Alfred). The art is incredibly good, there are some really unique panel designs and I loved some of the character designs like Catwoman. The hardcover edition looks great. The ending just feels very forced and cliche. While the first two volumes gave new life to classic characters, this story basically just shoehorns most of them back into traditional roles or barely develops them much at all (Alfred, Killer Croc). They introduce an entire Bat family in 2 pages, for no discernible reason. Many of the plot twists made me roll my eyes because they were so obvious. Maybe a younger audience will enjoy it, but I found very little in this fresh or interesting. Having just read the excellent 'The Three Jokers', this story felt almost like 'The Brave and the Bold' territory in comparison (Batdog... seriously), or just like a sillier version of the most recent movie and previous Batman story lines.

More of Nevada and Candice's backstories were explained, including a few secrets about the American's past.

jaw-dropping plot fun,"Wined and Died in New Orleans is the sophomore book in the Vintage Cookbook Mysteries written by the accomplished and amazingly cool author, Ellen Byron, a former television comedy writer with a long and thrilling history in Louisiana. I've read and enjoyed the author's other Louisiana-based series, which is truly one of the strongest of the genre, and I also began her latest series (written under a pen name) about a mafia-tangential protagonist based in New York City. I've got strong connections to both locations, so this makes Byron's books always in my top reading list... and now that this new series has us returning to Louisiana, I'm even more excited. From the traditional New Orleans flair and extravagance to the meticulous character development and dialog, readers will thoroughly love this series - one filled with the essence of the Louisiana cuisine, attitude, and larger-than-life characters. Set in a historic home, shop, and museum with a vintage cooking theme, readers meet long-lost relatives of a character we learned a lot about in the previous installment. But these folks are not people you'd want to meet in reality except for a laugh and a shock. When one of them kicks the bucket, you know the book's off to excellent start. And after we learn the true genealogical connections of the entire family, the jaw-dropping plot development pulls out all the surprising stops. Byron never fails to deliver a perfect ending, and I am super grateful for having received an early copy.

Wow!,"I am a huge fan of Anna Hackett's writings and ""The Detective"" was great. I enjoy the action infused with sexy romance between characters that struggle with their past personal experiences. I especially like that the badass men are prior military and obsessed with giving their all for the women they love. And their women are badasses who take the men on. Hunt and Savannah are an adorable couple and their story was exciting to read. I will continue with the next book in the Norcross series.

Loved It!,"I have only read a handful of titles by Sarah M. Eden so far and have discovered that I am becoming increasingly enchanted by any of her novels containing members of the Jonquil or Lancaster families. I was thrilled to see a chronological listing of these books as I turned the last page of The Best Intentions. And now my intention is to work through the list chronologically with the books that I have yet to read. This story was a beautiful romance between two people who had experienced more than their fair shares of difficult circumstances and disappointments. I was impressed with the author’s ability to create two different situations that Gillian and Scott were struggling with, yet the troubles they faced seemed impossible to overcome. I loved the way these two began to get to know each other and the way that love snuck up on them. And once that love was there, and acknowledged, I thought that their care and concern for each other showed what honorable and genuine people they were. It was great to see so many Jonquils and even one of the Gents in this novel! It makes me eager to start catching up with these characters in the books that I have yet to read. I received a complimentary copy of this book. All opinions are my own.",5,29/11/2022 19:22,"The Best Intentions: Book 1, The Huntresses",Kindle_Store,OR,
Great Read But So Many Questions. Series TAKE NOTES,"I had to read this book to compare to the current series on Showmax. They completely ruined Zandile's story. I love the actress they have playing Zandile and feel she embodies how Zandile is described...gorgeous, dimples, short, fashionable, etc. But the series fell short in showing so many of these pivotal moments that made Zandile and Nkosana's love shine. The series is so dark, and this book is lighthearted. Zandile was smart, could've been an attorney, does hair, had friends. Although she didnt understand the church, she wanted to incorporate it in her and her family's lives. Far cry from the tribalistic mess on the series. Zandile loved custard n pudding, and does not drink. Things that make her a normal human and connects her and Nkosana. Instead in the series, she's almost a dumb blond, always drinking, contributes nothing of substance and just nags. Far from Zandile the RESOLUTE. They even omit Nkosana's beautiful explanation of the ship. Nkosana is also emasculated and berated by Zandile in the series, painting him as a man that would let his pregnant wife go to jail for him, and painting Zandile as disrespectful when she had nothing but respect and adoration for that man, although firm. In this book, I loved seeing Nkosana's extremely jealous side, how he doesn't like Zandile wearing pants and his struggle with her getting a cell phone. In the series they dress her like she's going to board meetings AT HOME and her mullets... when in this book it says her hair is ON POINT. We didnt see Zandile struggle to drive or use a phone in the series. All things that build character relation. I love how Nkosana and Zandile do not mind showcasing their love in this story. In the series, its only when they are in the bedroom. No romantic dates, no PDA-- not even around the family. This book was everything, the series missed so many marks. The office scene, the gradual progression of Zandile and her kids' relationship, the mysterious child. The series doesnt even give a tangible explanation of why Zandile's dad hates her. I believe everything with the series went downhill when they changed the dynamics of Zandile's release from jail. They need to somehow rectify that so she is recognized as legally released so they can gear into the media drama effectively. They may need to just READ THE BOOK. The only pitfall of this book was the last moment in robbing Zandile of closing her own book out. There was NO NEED in switching to Hlomu's POV without explanation! Also why were the kids and Nkosana acting weird around the grandfather's death, the wedding almost being called off with no explanations and Buhle continuously being brought up only to disappear? SO many loose ends.",4,25/05/2022 02:17,ZANDILE: The Resolute (Book 2) (The Hlomu Series),Kindle_Store,OR,

AMAZING!!,"I am not even sure how to describe how much I LOVE The Hunted. I don’t want to pick favorites, because all of the books are so amazing… but if I had to pick- this one would take the cake (probably). If you have not read books 1-4, please pick up The Discovered immediately! You will not regret it. Maggie’s writing is so unique and engaging. You walk away after having read her books and they are so engulfing that you keep thinking about them. They have VERY powerful messages regarding emotional well-being and balance. Her writing is truly beautiful and always leaves you craving MORE. Warning this review contains SPOILERS. This book continues the beautiful world-building that we have grown accustomed to. You get to see Iciera and it is beautiful and so are all of the members of the coven. You truly see what it means for a coven to be in balance and it shows Áine and Daelon can finally see what they are fighting for. You will fall in love with all of the new characters. We get insight into Áine’s and Daelon’s minds… Lucien is not absent from this book and it is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! (He is my favorite, and I am Team Lucien 100%). The ending will leave you desperate for the October release of book 5. This book is amazing.",5,05/07/2022 19:27,The Hunted (The Lost Witches of Aradia Book 4),Kindle_Store,OR,
wow great addition,"This is what Amy Lane is great at!  Taking a group of strangers, forming a ensemble,  then fighting for a common cause and becoming family. The story began  many years ago with two young men falling in love. That would be Danny and Felix. Meeting Julia Salinger , her life a living hell they became 3. This is their story living through these pages leading a band of young people to become the Robin Hood's of our times. This group has many players, all good in different fields of expertise. Once they are given a problem, come hell or high water they work to achieve it. Its sometimes works like a McGiver show (you might be too young to understand this ) and sometimes its magical clock work. with one of the group finding there HEA.

Great start,"First off, I am not a Trekor, so you can trust that my review is not from someone who might be biased towards all things ST.  I felt the need to write this review also because of the huge volume of ST comics and other memorabilia that exists to honor the original series in particular.  Some of it is better than others and as a plain old sci to fan I've been through a lot of it.  This five year series treats the original canon with respect, and doesn't go too far out on a limb in my view.  What I mean is there aren't attempts to insert woke culture that would not fit into any expansion of the original five year mission that goes where no ""man"" has gone before.  You will find examples that attempt this and I think will be in agreement that it doesn't fit cleanly with Roddenberry's original vision.  For that reason I do recommend this to fans of the original series, whether trekor or plain sci to fans like me.",5,07/06/2022 21:14,Star Trek: Year Five – Odyssey's End (Book 1),Kindle_Store,OR,
THIS IS A PREQUEL! And SO GOOD,"Oh my gosh this book was so good! Thankfully I realized while reviewing the book reviews on book one that book 6 was actually a prequel to the series, so I made sure to read this one first. I had added this series to my TBR list previously and hadn’t realized that this was a prequel, so I am so glad that I got to start this series with a bang from the start! This book reminded me a lot of Stephen kings IT, with the group of guys and single gal who are the best of the best friends, but also going through puberty and realizing that their feelings for each other are changing and that all the guys want the gal, and the gal still wants all the guys! I really like the way that the author built up the spice and the anticipation between the characters, there isn’t any actual played out spice in this prequel but I feel like that makes sense because they are teens. Also, TRIGGER WARNING and SPOILER, there is an attempted rape scene in this prequel but it was really well written and build a lot of the story and the character development, so definitely be mindful of that.  Some folks are going to find triggering, but I found that it really went to the story in a good way and I applaud the way that the authors handled the scene and the fall out.

Laughably silly,"I’ll give this book credit, it’s entertaining if you don’t take it seriously. There are some good points. A fairly standard video game-like system that the world works in akin to an MMO. Familiar types of skills and workings. And the main character gets an interesting set of skills that make him abnormal. There’s enough character variety and persona to keep me interested, and the story is whimsical and fun enough. The bad; this is laughably simple in terms of writing. So many rules are broken. I can’t count the number of -ly adverbs because there’s just too many. The author also has no concept of size. One of the main skills the MC uses is called stone bullet. It’s supposed to be a stone that fires, and is roughly eight inches in diameter. That’s HUGE. That’s not a stone, it’s a boulder! Eventually, he goes on to utilize a 1 foot diameter stone and calling it small. For reference, a softball isn’t even 4 INCHES in diameter. The story also has many lewd points and overly sexualizes females.  There’s also hints towards incest with the MC’s younger sister. I’m not sure if I’ll read on to book 2 or not. I purchased the entire series due to a recommendation of a friend. I’m not seriously reconsidering that friendship…",2,09/01/2023 11:47,The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter (Light Novel) Vol. 1,Kindle_Store,OR,

That is just not realistic at all. As a sexual assault survivor, you're telling me this girl went through 10x worse things but yet doesn't have the issues I'm still working through and it's been almost 10 years since I survived??

Sacrificed to the Fae King series light,"I'm a big fan of Lola Glass and I really enjoyed her ""Sacrificed to the Fae King"" series. The idea of two mates holding half of a power was well explored, and the characters felt fully defined and flushed out. Sadly this series wasn't as successful even though it held similar themes. I'm glad she gave a tie up to the third set of mates because unfortunately this novel lacked some of the colorful, artful touches of the previous book in the series. It felt a bit like she was a quarter through writing it when the first novel sales came through and when it wasn't a hit, it got wrapped up quickly. I don't know that I would have done anything differently in her place as I think overall many of her novels are more successful when she gives 2-3 novels to each couple and the stories take place at least partly on earth in current time. I'd love to see a set of novels exploring how witches find their fated mates, giving them an interesting courting process. Or a series where the fated mates need to time travel to find one another. Something that turns the genre on its head, versus just placing it in another world.

Spicy hockey why choose 🥵🫣🤤,"***i was an ARC reader for this book, but my review is my opinion only**** So. Freaking. Good. Clench your legs together, GOOD. I cannot convey how steamy and passion filled this story is. You want spice? Check. You want a why choose story with extremely hot people? Check. You want hockey romance with possessiveness? Check. You want a story that’s so good you can’t put it down? Check. Jake - ahhh goofy, lovable, heart on his sleeve jake. He is panty melting from the prequel, and then he just gets better and funnier. He’s rugged, but sensitive. He has his insecurities, but he wants what he wants and protects what/who is his. He learns a new side to himself and new feelings for others. He becomes free to be who he wants. I wish we saw more of him coming into hisself. Carter - good ole broody Caleb. Former hockey player, now equipment manager. He has a guard up and keeps people at a distance. When he’s all in, he’s all in. He’s bi and in love with his best friend for years. He’s also got certain equipment that’s very, very beneficial to them alllll! I do wish he would’ve gotten some one on one scenes with Jake about his feelings that he has had all along. Ilmari - Holy tatted Thor! He’s Finnish and quiet and keeps to himself. He doesn’t let people in, friends or teammates, he’s a big, broody guy on the outside, but has a big ole heart on the inside. He faces some obstacles, but with help he over comes them. He lets his guards down and comes out of his shell and gains a family. He is smoking and his Finnish sayings? Adds even more sexiness to him. Oh and did I mention tree trunk thighs and a man bun? Swooon Rachel - girl is a bad ass woman. She’s grown up in the spotlight. She’s had experience in all sorts of things tagging along with her rockstar dad. She’s worked hard to recover from choices that she made when she was younger.

Enjoyable Read,"First Command was an enjoyable read. Cassi was a likable protagonist and the most fleshed-out character. I enjoyed the action sequences, especially the initial crash onto the alien planet. I was curious about each crew member and anxious to learn more about their lives and backstories. As the story progressed, I expected some breaks from the action sequences to learn more about the characters. We got Cassi's backstory, but I wanted to know more about the other characters. (Maybe a sequel is in the works?) I would be interested in a spin-off focusing on Quinton's character, who suffered the most. He was my favorite character next to Cassi. I also appreciated the question of morality regarding space exploration and colonization. I thought Cassi handled the matter with courage and maturity, even when her mother tried to turn her astray.

Book Two is Fabuluos,"Book Two by Ava Richardson 'Dragon's Protector' is Fabulous.  Book Two's pace has picked up and the adventures start in right away.  It's been four months since Yanna has started studying mage craft and Dragon Riding at Stonehaven and she is beginning to wonder if her focus should be on Dragon Riding. Like any student it's not unusual to question your major in school. Ava writes about Yanna's mage schooling in detail.  The investigative research Yanna does shows how helpful she is to the magic society.  I love how Ava brings in the benefits of forensic investigation, critical thinking, and problem solving in mage craft versus the aspects of just power in war and dragon riding and how important it is to find solutions to problems even in war.  Yanna also learns the importance the choices we make.  Are we choosing for the greater good of all or making smaller personal choices that helps only ourselves?  Yanna is growing in leaps and bounds with dangerous twist and turns, unexpected surprises, enemies and a family reunion.  This book is packed with everything take my word for it.

Great couple,"I liked these guys together so very much. Porter is a seemingly somewhat mild Veterinarian. Just opened a new practice as soon as he graduated, bought the practice from the retiring local vet he always helped out at since he was a teenager. And he’s overwhelmed somewhat, no time for dating. But feeling something missing. Steele owns a garage, and his crew are crazy mechanics. He’s kind of a curmudgeon but trying to be a participant with all the guys after work too. Nothing is sacred, and they are so fun. Steele is constantly razzed about his dating life. Always ends dating each one for one seemingly nitpicky reason or another. He just ignores the the guys. But is starting to really feel something is missing. One night while playing pool with the guys he sees Porter sitting at the bar, and something clicks. They click. He’s unaware they’ve actually met several times at other bbq’s etc the guys are always having, either at one of their places or at one of the guys from Four Bear Construction (a GREAT series). He’d never stayed very long just put in an appearance and left. At the 4th of July bbq at Sawyers and West’s home, Steele sees him and snaps yes he’s seen him many times, and he feels like an idiot. And he can’t tear himself away, something just clicks, in such a huge way. And this time he doesn’t let Porter get away. They both are too busy and tired to pursue anything, yet they’re pulled toward each other so strongly. This is a great story of how romance happens whether you’re ready or not. And I loved every minute.",5,26/08/2022 14:04,Crankshaft (Big Bull Mechanics Book 1),Kindle_Store,OR,

Hurts my heart to see this series so off,"I bought all of these issues, as Ben Grimm has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  I was hoping for a fun, fired up adventure that features the one-liners and cocky attitude of the hero that made me collect Marvel Two-in-Ones and Fantastic Four comics.  Instead, I got a neutered, random, incoherent story that often made Ben a secondary character to the kid and female character they wrote in.  He is bland, depressed, and just gets thrown from one situation to the next without really developing anything.  The Thing is a good humored, beer drinking, cigar chomping, looking for a good rumble heart of gold character.  They just do not get him at all.",2,17/09/2022 23:16,The Thing (2021-2022) #2 (of 6),Kindle_Store,OR,
An excellent historical fiction series of books.  A Terrible Loyalty books 1-3.  Good reads,"I have read many, many historical fiction novels and this is a very good read.  The characters are believable, the author gives you insight as to their thoughts and feelings, while keeping the read going.  Some of the insights go a bit longer than needed, for my taste, but they do help develop the character and explain why they react the way they do in certain situations.  The book is set in the submarine war of the South Pacific and is believable and interesting.  Enough actual events are tied into the novels to make it seem like non-fiction.  I look forward to William Roskey's next edition!",5,05/10/2022 18:19,A TERRIBLE LOYALTY--BOOK 3: A World War II Submarine Novel,Kindle_Store,OR,

"Ten BBW, age gap books in one","The Ultimate Steamy Romance Collection contains 10 stories, all of which feature an Alpha Male, a BBW, and age gap, and explicit steamy scenes. All of them feature a Virgin Heroine, except Delivery Man. The stories follow the same basic storyline, which I won’t spoil here. The first three followed so closely that it was like reading the same story three times in a row. But things did get a bit more interesting. All of the stories feature a HEA. There is no cheating or cliffhangers. If you want a fun and easy read with some smut, this collection is for you. These stories are loosely interconnected, all taking place in the same mountain town. The stories are in the series Mountain Ink, referring to a tattoo parlor. The only connection to the tattoo parlor in these stories, however, is the fact that the heroine in the first story has a father who owns the tattoo parlor. Maybe there are more books in the series that relate? Oh well. This didn’t take away from my enjoyment of the stories. Okay. The Breakdown: 1) Obsessed H/h- Gage and Raven Trope- Hot Professor 3/5 2) Dirty Talker H/h- Declan and Addie Trope: Workplace Romance 3/5 3) Temptress H/h- Hawk and Violet Trope: Captor Romance 3/5 This story had a bit of BDSM Lite. The stories get better after this one. 4) Lone Wolf H/h Walker and Birdie Trope: Mail-Order Bride (with a twist) 4/5 The main takeaway from this one is that the heroine doesn’t wear shoes. I predict babies and frostbite in her future. I did enjoy the Mountain Man aspect. 5) Savage H/h- Montana and Cordd Trope: Fake Relationship 4/5 This story had a really interesting setting for most of it- a tourist train in the mountains (based in the mountain town). I also found the love scenes to be a little less by rote and a little more steamy than the previous four. 6) Delivery Man H/h- Flint and Pearl Trope- Pregnant Damsel in Distress 4/5 The H and h are the brother and sister, respectively of the H and h of the previous story. Also notable because h is not a virgin. I did find that the heroine had Too Stupid to Live Syndrome, but it did further the plot and wasn’t too annoying. 7) Scrooge H/h- Dustin and Roxie Trope: Cowboy in Shining Armor 5/5 The age gap between the H and h was particularly hot and sexy in this one. Also a bit of BDSM Lite. There was a unique and utterly cool moment when the heroine was wondering whether her submission contradicted her strength as a woman and her feminism. I was psyched and gave it an extra star. Unfortunately, the heroine didn’t come to any conclusions (that she shared, anyway). 8) Innocent H/h- Huck and Janie Trope: Virginity Auction (with a twist) 4/5 This trope can often get pretty hardcore fast, but not the case here. The Hero was very sweet. There was a realistic concern by the h that the H’s son (who is close to the h’s age) would be upset about the relationship. I felt this added to the story. 9) Lumberjack H/h- Bo and Rose Trope: Wrongly Convicted and On the Run 5/5 One of the reasons I especially liked this one is because expectations were turned around: the heroine is the Convict On the Run, not the Hero. I enjoyed the relationship between the H and h and especially his loyalty and his ingenuity in solving the problem.  I laughed out loud when the heroine jokes about Instalove and the stereotypical romance novel plot, even as all of the stories in the book followed this basic plot outline. It showed the author’s sense of humor and willingness to poke fun at herself. 10) Bookworm H/h- Holt and Ann Trope: Nanny (Caregiver) Romance 5/5 I felt extra warmth from these characters and enjoyed the secondary characters. The heroine is a bookworm and loves romance novels and I might could find that relatable ;) Interesting bits about a working ranch, and the heroine has realistic concerns about the Hero riding rodeo. Overall, an entertaining, lighthearted collection of stories. It definitely follows a formula, but gives the reader what they want. Recommended.

As this documentary demonstrated, the evidence is most certainly there but its the archaeologists' perception of the time that's off.

People! Funny how no one bothered to mention the scripture that said we would lose track of time. Never even considered it. Still, this documentary is well worth the watch especially for those who are skeptical but refreshing for those of us who are not.

I almost expected them to drop an 800 number to order the gadgets they were using (call now and we'll throw in a second Tic-Tac Detector FREE!). None of the evidence is particularly compelling, and there's a lot of wild assumptions being tossed about. All of this is interlaced with a perky, way-too-excited host who clumsily employs technobabble, sometimes while interviewing William Shatner...who doesn't seem entirely sure why he's there.

"Dark but well-made movie, heavy with themes of abuse","Antlers (2021), an American supernatural horror film, adapted from Nick Antosca’s short story “The Quiet Boy” published in 2019. Set in the small central Oregon town of Cispus Falls, schoolteacher Julia Meadows (Keri Russell) is concerned about the welfare of one of her students, 12-year-old Lucas Weaver (Jeremy T. Thomas). Lucas makes scary drawings of monsters, his father hasn’t been seen in days, and oh Lucas likes to collect and bring roadkill home (if he doesn’t kill the animals himself). Julia, aside from just being a good teacher, is also motivated by personal experience of having been abused herself and of guilt of having left her brother behind when she left home. That brother, Paul (Jesse Plemons), is the local sheriff, and reluctantly gets involved in Julia’s efforts to help Lucas.  Sadly, Lucas’ drawings aren’t metaphorical cries for help, as Bad Things are happening at home. His dad (among others) is going Wendigo, turning into a horrible, antler-clad, demonic bipedal deer creature that likes to eat people. It’s a dark movie, literally and figuratively. Sets are dark, it is dark horror, and it’s also dark in the sense of being bleak, with Cispus Falls a sad, depressed town in despair, Lucas’ family even before going Wendigo not exactly a happy family, Julia and Paul still very much dealing with a legacy of parental abuse. Production values are good, good suspense, loved the creature design. It’s a violent movie, though I really liked how people didn’t do stupid things around the creatures but vigorously fought back. Acting, casting, all good. It’s a somber movie and like a lot of arty, indie horror films, it isn’t just a horror movie but heavy with metaphors about abuse and unhappy families and meth-ridden Oregon towns.  I do think the Native American aspects could have been detailed or played up a lot better. There are some nods towards Native American aspects and I was pleased to see an actual book I read on the Wendigo briefly shown, though I think overall, my definitely unprofessional opinion, this Wendigo had far more in common with Western pop culture views of Wendigo than Native beliefs. The core aspects of hunger and cannibalism seemed to ring true.",4,08/04/2022 04:27,Antlers,Movies_and_TV,OR,

A perfect blend of fragility and strength.,"I feel like this movie is the one that ""Forrest Gump"" was supposed to be but wasn't.  What happens when fate takes you to places you couldn't imagine, and when you get there you know it's exactly the right place to be? What happens when everything that couldn't have been is, and everything that could have been is, too? Not a tear-jerker.  None of the characters are overdrawn; even the war didn't distract from the story. A film to watch every few years as I wander forward from 70.",5,20/10/2022 06:04,,Movies_and_TV,OR,
Much much better than the 2019 reboot,"My favorite episode is ""Cradle Of Darkness"", which makes you ask yourself if you could murder Adolf Hitler as an infant.  Truly thought-provoking.  They did an incredible job of making it feel very Twilight Zone, in its production. That wasn't the only episode that felt like Twilight Zone, though.  They also did some legitimate remakes like ""The Martians Due On Main Street"" and ""Eye Of The Beholder"" and the cream of the crop of classic nostalgia Twilight zone:  Its STILL A Good Life, starring the one and only monster child Bill Mumy and his real daughter, as well as Chloris Leachman. Fantastic way to reboot an episode so classic, by have the original cast return and carry on from the past.  Beautifully executed! This entire series meshes the old with new and was a brilliant way to grab the youth to learn about The Twilight Zone and enjoy it. As one that is a fan of the OG series...I strongly encourage anyone to buy and watch this entire series.  Just like the old series, some are better than others but you won't be disappointed, unless you can't read - and thought this was the Rod Serling classic version. It clearly says Forest Whitaker as bold as the sun. Enjoy!",5,13/04/2022 09:50,The Twilight Zone - The Complete Series (Season One),Movies_and_TV,OR,

"Hypnosis 101 - or watch this film, your choice!","I don't want to be disrespectful to the Jewish population in any way and I make no disparaging remarks aimed at them but rather at this attempt to doccument what happened in Warsaw by people who know NOT what happened by any first-hand account but only by 2nd-hand telling and retelling. Granted, the original film produced by the Nazis would be worth watching for historical value and for rememberence if only one could watch it without the added commentary by the narrator and the additional footage added to this documentary that is not part of the Nazi film. Why is it that people who want to narrate documentaries have a tendency to put the viewer to sleep with their dull, monotone delivery.  Most of them don't have a pleasant voice to start with.  Then add into the recipie the element that they KNOW NOT what they speak of but are only reading words on a page written by someone else.  Now you have an audio stew guaranteed to put Eval Kneival to sleep in the middle of his Jump over the Grand Canyon. There are so many voices that one could get who could do an outsanding job of holding the viewer's interest so why did this outfit settle for a 3rd rate narrator?",1,31/08/2022 18:39,,Movies_and_TV,OR,

Ended better then It started but...,"It is not that good of a romance.  It is no where near the sappy sweetness of a Hallmark but it is a far cry from a Netflix rational practical romance story.  The FMC is overly hostile to the MMC considering he didn't lie to her or do anything negative to her to begin with to warrant this behavior from her.  Having said that, the MMC was so wimpy that he needed a hard female like this one is to push him out of his weird box.  If the producers had chosen any other actor for this roll the MMC would have been gay he was so femine as to be unreal in thought. Anyway, if it wasn't for the relatable FMC (even with her hostilities), and the telenovela showdown in the last 15 minutes of the movie, AND 2 nice songs on this movies soundtrack, it would have been a pretty bad movie.  All of what I mentioned saved this movie.  It really did leave me smiling and I laughed a couple of times too.  It's worth a shot for romance nuts like me.

Close to the truth but too much spin,"First off, why is it necessary to use so much profanity in the movie? This is nor a documentary about some drug dealer or house of prostitution. This is not a family friendly movie. The movie paints Richard Jewell as some type of country bumpkin or fool, which is an insult to his memory. He was and is a true hero. Nothing can change that. I recommend that a movie like this one be watched if one ever comes out. I am mixed about recommending this one. The story needs to be told in any case in light of today's headlines of FBI raids on President's houses and entrapping people to commit crimes.

It was heartbreaking to watch a standing crowed penned in by non-moving barriers that had a sudden large wave of people rushing into the penned sections with nowhere else to go. The documentary targeted planning errors like the fencing split (aisles for security) and the crowded quadrant where the crowd collapsed. When the event from the 2nd stage finished, concertgoers flooded over toward the main stage. There was nowhere for the crowd surrounded on 3 sides by fences to go, once the pushing surge started.",5,10/11/2022 10:30,,Movies_and_TV,OR,

Love letter to all things Lucio Fulci,"An homage is tough to pull off, especially when you announce your intentions up front.  Nightmare Symphony (2020) is not just a love letter to all things Lucio Fulci - the Italian director whose biggest success came during a particular gore drenched string of international hits during the ‘80s – but a reboot of one film in particular:  Cat in the Brain (aka Nightmare Concert) which took an autobiographical approach to tell a behind-the-scenes horror story of a director suffering a creative crisis. In Nightmare Symphony, Frank LaLoggia (director of Fear No Evil and Lady in White) plays a fictionalized version of himself, just putting the finishing touches on his new film.  But his arrival in Italy is marred by the vicious murder of his female star, poor feedback from his collaborator and outrageous demands by his producer.  His only lifeline is Isabelle (Antonella Salvucci), editor and ex-lover, who attempts to talk Frank down from the creative cliff.  But the murders continue, targeting the very troublemakers who have been sabotaging the project, causing Frank to question his own motivations…and sanity. Full of Fulci references and past collaborators (screenwriter Antonio Tentori, who plays himself, wrote the original A Cat in the Brain in 1990) there’s certainly no doubt the co-directors Domiziano Cristopharo and Daniele Trani are huge fans of the genre.  And with very limited resources they’ve managed to tell a competent – if familiar – story that reflects the horrors of the loss of creative control.  LaLoggia, who bears a striking resemblance to Paul Giamatti, deserves particular credit for pulling of a great bit of non-acting as the director struggling to recover his mojo. But for a film built around the giallo format, Nightmare Symphony gets the pacing all wrong.  Opening with a drawn-out torture sequence full of cool blues and scarlet blood, the film is so enamored with the mechanics of it all, it forgets to add the suspense.  Subsequent killings revel in the same cut-rate make-up effects, but are almost completely bereft of the visceral impact Fulci managed to achieve.  Nightmare Symphony is a plagiarized love letter to Italian cinema that’s all style but no heart. The Blu-ray release features a pair of interviews and behind-the-scenes reel, along with a chapter-based copy of the score, with a killer main title theme from Fabio Frizzi.",2,08/01/2023 18:53,Nightmare Symphony (Special Edition) [Blu-ray],Movies_and_TV,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZbDC1RI7L._SL1600_.jpg

The more you watch, the more you want to watch.

Visually decent fantasy anime.,"Originally titled Birthday Wonderland, this feature was based on Sachiko Kashiwaba's children's book from 1988. Keiichi Hara from Doraemon directed this for Warner Bros. Japan, even though it didn't get a wide American theatrical release, which has widely been seen as being a Studio Ghibli wannabe film. Akane is a middle schooler feeling left out of her friends' social circle, and decides to spend the day before her birthday at home pretending to be sick. Her mother sends her on an errand to a family friend Chii, who runs her own nick-nack store. While there, Akane accidently put her hand on an old clay handprint, which summons a mysterious top-hatted man appears from Chii's basement calling himself Hippocrates along with his fairy companion. Akane is labeled as the chosen Green Goddess meant to save this alternative world from running out of water, so she and Chii travel to this magical realm that somehow diverted into its own timeline due to interdimensional spiders capable of creating pathways to different worlds. Once in this ""wonderland"", our heroes' enthusiasm changes as Chii wants to explore it, but Akane merely wishes to return to her own world. The movie does have some stunning character designs, colorful backgrounds, and an endearing soundtrack. The plot and character development though seriously drags in this near 2-hour long movie, making it seem more amateurish for such a lavish visual production. The Wonderland is a decent screening for a lazy Sunday afternoon, but not exactly worth going out of your way for.",3,06/04/2022 22:02,The Wonderland [Blu-ray],Movies_and_TV,OR,

Love dogs. Love Channing. This movie...not so much.,"I'm a sucker for a good dog movie or book. Marley and Me? Art of Racing in the Rain? Where the Red Fern Grows? Yep, love 'em all.  And Channing Tatum is an actor I usually enjoy. This movie looked like it checked all the boxes...dog, Channing, comedy, road trip, respect for military... what could go wrong?  Well, I'm not sure what did, but for me, this film was just kind of empty. It kept feeling like it was going to live up to its potential but it just kept falling short. Just one man's opinion.",3,28/08/2022 07:34,,Movies_and_TV,OR,

A+,"Very late to the party. I watched The vampire diaries very recently with my 15-year-old niece... romantic and fun little teenage drama, I enjoyed it. The originals, however, is a very well done series with a grown up feel. Anyway I'm enjoying it very much I just finished season 1 and about to start season 2. The acting is stupendous for this type of a series.. wow. My only real question is why the heck didn't they develop Hayley into a more meaningful character.. I mean I couldn't care less about her but it would have been nice to get an idea of what the heck Elijah is so attracted to in her other than she's a cute girl that's pregnant with his brothers baby. Other than that she's of absolutely no interest.",5,03/08/2022 23:25,,Movies_and_TV,OR,

Lovely to watch again and again!,"I loved this movie when it was first released and still love it (and re-watch it often) years later! Anyone who grew-up on 'Pop-up Video' will enjoy an added layer of nostalgia and irony, along with song stylings reminscent of George Michael/Wham (Meaningless Kiss) and other fun boy band and 'one-hit-wonders' of the 90s. Hugh Grant brings his sardonic and understated British humor to the film, while Drew B brings many breaths of fresh air along with strong support by Kristen Johnston. It's a rom-com that really works from music to lyrics to melody.",5,26/04/2022 01:50,,Movies_and_TV,OR,

Missed opportunity,"I wanted to like this film. I like Sy. The beginning is good. First of all the girlfriend is unattractive. The mother is unattractive. I don't know if that's supposed to be funny. Sy should've beaten up more people and enjoyed the women more. The film needed more jokes. He chemistry with his Latin partner could've been better. At one point his partner refers to him as a piece of s... Really? Not funny. There was plenty of action at the end. The happy ending was enjoyable. The script needed more humor, a sexy costar and more action. Sy needs to choose better scripts. And please use some Chap stick. The brothers lips looked chapped.

"We might get old, but then we get BETTER.","Revenge movies have been around along time. Just as I thought they couldn't make another one. This film came. The ""OLD"" school meets the scum ""Young"" ferels. And teach the kids that they have no idea what being badass is. A ""gang"" or ""group"" going by a name like ""E2"" does not do a thing for me. They are just a gang that together just cause fear in numbers to be what makes them feared. But alone they crumble. Not in the case when up against 70 plus year old FRIENDS. Take what's going on in the inner cities here in the USA. Every weekend small thugs create fear and the mayors and others just crumble to them.

This just saved me over an hours time and possibly a dead dog,"I just rescued my jack Russel/pit mix just shy of 2 months ago. He was set to be euthanized by a shelter, so my local humane society picked him up, and 2 days after, I adopted him. The first week I had him, he took off. VERY HIGH kill drive in this dog (He is mostly jack Russell). The first time he took off I thought he was gone. I ran for an hour between 3 blocks of houses trying to catch him, but he did not care. After 1 hour and 4 neighbors, we were able to catch him...but only after he had already given up. I took away all off leash privileges and purchased this collar. Then I got lax. All has been well (I've even let him off leash WITHOUT the collar on, because he has been minding me quite well...until this morning. We were just going to the back yard to use the bathroom and back into the house (off leash) when he made the SAME dash as he did nearly 2 months ago. I tried yelling for him to stop, but he did not care. I (won't happen again) RAN into the house to grab the collar remote because it's only good up to 1600ft and I started hitting the button from inside the house. I heard him yelping from inside the house. I ran out and when he wasn't being shocked, he was trying to take back off. So I zapped him again so that I could get him on his lead and back into the house. Mind you, this was on setting 1 of 100. Never again little buddy.

The color was as pictured and it looks really nice. I'm also a huge fan of the tag loop! It's so much easier to get those little key rings on that than with a traditional D ring. This collar passed the ultimate test when my dog crawled under a parked car two days after the collar arrived. She and the collar came out covered in grease and dirt. I just rubbed a bit of dish soap on the collar, tossed it in the washing machine with the rest of the laundry, and it came out good as new!

Decided  the old style carrier is just too heavy, for this senior citizen.  Came home and immediately went on an Amazon search for a wheeled cat carrier, which came today, 3 days after ordering!  When not in use the carrier folds flat.  Wheels easy to attach and detach.  It is just so easy to pull.  Put 4 of my normal sized cats in the carrier for a trial run.  So easy to wheel them around.

I wish I could show more than one video.,"[[VIDEOID:ecb26c79c149868c78a45d5eeb1cf15e]] The main attraction to this toy is the feather coming out of the holes. I wish I could have posted that video as well , but there's only one video allowed . But I did want to say that my cat was not thrilled about the ball rolling around until I put some catnip in it. Then he really went after it. It's slightly hard to get the ball out and back in. What I would say is wrong with the ball is that there's big enough holes for the catnip to spill out. But other than that he really liked it. He didn't really get too thrilled about the toy on the top that spins around. He is 11 years old but still is always looking for something to play with. My guess is that he will get sick of trying to get the feather after a while so I'll have to put it away and bring it back out. I think a younger cat would like the butterfly toy, but for him it was kind of an annoyance. Overall it's a nice toy, but a bit expensive in my opinion.

My dogs love it!,"My dogs are really enjoying this food.  It arrived completely frozen.  I put 6 packs in the freezer and one in the refrigerator.  By the next day, the one in the refrigerator had thawed and was ready for use.  There's a good deal of food in each packet.  I have 2 big dogs, so this food wouldn't be affordable for their primary meal, but I've been mixing it in with their kibble.  My picky dog gobbles down her entire bowl when I include some of this in her bowl.  By mixing a small amount in each dog's bowl, I'm able to able to stretch each pack out for the 5 days that the manufacturer recommends as the number of days this product will remain fresh in the refrigerator. These packets look unpleasant when the food is in the plastic pouch, but once added to the bowl, it reminds me of stuffing and actually looks appetizing.  I'm vegetarian, but I would be tempted to try it myself if I wasn't vegetarian. Overall,  I think this is a good food.  My dogs like it a lot and it makes me happy to feed this food to them.",5,13/03/2023 14:29,"JustFoodForDogs Frozen Fresh Human Grade Dog Food, Healthy Weight Variety Pack, 18 Oz (7 Pack)",Pet_Supplies,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Rmz3jdjFL._SL1600_.jpg

wont keep dog from using his mouth.,"I was looking for something to keep my guy from barking, eating and drinking from just any source outdoors. They showed the muzzle on a long muzzled dog (GS) so I took his measurements as shown. As you can see by my photos, the muzzle didn’t cover 1/2 his snoot. He still has enough exposed muzzle to give him strength to open his mouth (it is as tight as it gets). It doesn’t prevent barking, even a little. so I won’t trust it to prevent him from eating anything. After seeing it on him, I don’t think it would take him long to get it off with his paws either. Ad says ANTI biting, barking, chewing and DRINKABLE. i have to wonder if he can’t bite, bark, or chew how can he drink? Ive seen my dog drink and he does it with his mouth open.

"Easy setup, works well.","Update: After like 2 months of use, it's having a meltdown for some reason. I keep it hooked into a surge protector and we've had no storms so it's not electrical on my end. This thing beeps often and spins around in full circles and since it wasn't designed to work in a full circle- it throws litter out the front all over the place when it does a full circle. Eventually I can get it to stop and go back to it's normal position but a couple hours later I hear non stop beeping and see it making circles and throwing litter out. This things gone crazy! This was very easy to set up and it works well, with no major complaints. It also works without the app for those who don't use apps for things like this. I pushed the four feet in, put the tray in the bottom, filled it with litter, put the scent thing in the tray, and plugged it in and it cycled it to level the litter and the litter is like perfectly level once that's done. The next couple of days a couple of cats have gone #1 in it and it did a good job at sifting it into the tray in the bottom and I notice no smell around the box at all. The cats still currently prefer one of their old boxes as they hate change, but I'm hoping they realize this box is always clean and go to it in time. SO functionality, this waits a bit after your cat is out and then it rotates very quietly to one side to dump the waste into the bottom and rotates a bit back the other way to level the litter. If you put your hand up to the doorway of it in this cycle, it will stop until it's sure there are no cats in/ around the box- great safety feature that works well. This box looks nice and is well enough made. I would point out that it's maybe best suited for a small to medium size cat. It's not a tiny box and a large cat could fit in there but it won't be that roomy and our big boy seems to love to stretch out as he does his business so I think he'll probably never touch this box but the two smaller cats will possibly. So my recommendation is to keep at least a box or so in the house if you have multiple cats. This box does not count as more than one for multi cats, it still counts as just one box. Cats that are territorial might be upset by there only one box and start spraying around the house. Don't blame them if this happens, it's your fault for not having researched it first. Cats and their litterboxes are a delicate ecosystem that if you upset it, causes chaos. So be careful whatever you do or you'll upset the balance and have spraying everywhere. Overall this is a pretty nice-looking, well-made, functional box, I do recommend it if you understand what you're getting into. There's always the possibility that your cat will want nothing to do with it so always have at least one box available.",1,18/10/2022 17:55,"HHOlove Automatic Cat Litter Box, Self Cleaning Cat Litter Box with Remote App Control, Alerts, Odor Suppression, Disassembly for Multiple Cats",Pet_Supplies,OR,

Heavy and good,"Where I live, this is not a common looking lock. So, that alone likely helps look past my bike to the next one using a chain, cable, or u lock. I like that it folds compactly and fits on the frame. It is a bit heavy. But, that is the price you pay for any level of security. In practical use, locking the bike, I find it a little cumbersome and difficult. A little. Some of it is just getting used to this style, new places, and my bike. It always feels like it is just a little too short. If you have used a u-lock, you'll understand the initial puzzle of how you're going to lock up your bike.  This lock presents the same puzzle, but seems like it would be easier, but not much. I like that it does not scratch my bike. It has a fairly large key compared to my u-lock.  I wish they made a combination version for my son who doesn't ride enough to keep up with a key.  Maybe they do it I missed it. ? In any case, I like this lock quite a bit.

It is about 23 in long So I was able to fit both my feet behind each other but it can be a little bit squished. The wide wheels look very nice and they do perform pretty well. The suspension is also pretty good making the ride very smooth, however it is very noisy in terms of a squeaking and whatnot. Today I rode the scooter about 11 mi and I still had about 28% battery left. So I would assume the mileage is about 16 mi realistic. I was riding mostly at top speed with some hills and decent wind.

buy what you can while you can!,"Whatever, buy what you can while you can. Prices going up and up, availability will go down. Buy extra every time when at store. If you are at a spot where buying emergency marketed foods are within your budget, then by all means do so. Tuck it away. Todays cost will be more than paid for come tomorrow, ya know? Go for what you like to eat, go for variety. If you are deciding between vegetables, peas are nice way to go because they offer more nutrients (esp protein) over some options (such as corn). I pretty much only grab emergency food when it is on sale. I often just tuck it away and forget it. But I will occasionally buy it and use it if it happens to be cheaper than a non emergency packed food that I use regularly. I like Augason Farms quality and for the most part pricing. They have quite an assortment. I typicalluy buy the #10 cans (number ten) for stack ability, uniformity, readability, and ease of getting into (just a regular can opener).

Easy to move, by pulling up and attaching locking slide on side.  Then pull around on wheels. Also space saving if you want to keep it locked up as one piece and pull down as needed.  The speed setting was easy to use - found 3 - 3 1/2 was perfect for myself.  The incline adjustment also worked well.",4,19/04/2022 18:57,"Geniqua 800W Folding Electric Treadmill Running Machine Cardio Workout Jogging Fitness Exercise Program w/Wheels, Digital Monitor, Adjustable Incline",Sports_and_Outdoors,OR,

"Does not work well with large gearcase 5.44"" Mercury Engines.","15x15 4 blade  RH prop on 2022 Mercury 300 four stroke V8 It is a beautiful propeller.  The issue with the large gearcase is the vent holes in the prop. Unlike mercury props - you can't seal them very well.  Turning point suggested using ""well nuts"" (google it) which was tried. 3/4 of them fell out after 20 minutes.  Because the gearcase is larger than the hub diameter, it probably produces a low pressure area as the water passes the transition from 5.44"" to 4.75"".  (see stock image) This overexaggerates the bubble effect on the prop at speed.  This leads to vibration and inefficiency.  This is in comparison to a Mercury Enertia Eco prop (which costs at least twice as much) But most of the reviews on this thing are fantastic.

Practice at home,"I, like a lot of parents, spend a lot of time on bleachers. I have a standard stadium seat from a local sporting goods store but it is not as cushioned as it once was. Recently my daughter started outdoor sports and I didn't realize how cold I was going to get, I thought this would be a two birds, one stone situation. I wanted to try this one because my husband had recently bought a similar style but neither of us are small and neither of us could fit in the chair, even my daughter who is very small couldn't fit in in comfortably so I was worried that would be the case with this one. I am able to sit in this with both arms up but it is a little tight (for reference I wear a size 14-16 and I've had two kids and my hips show it). I decided to try the chair without the arms up and it took me quite a while to figure it out because one arm kept staying up and one would stay down. I finally realized that when the chair is flat you need to press down on the arm until you hear it click and then you could fold it in half to sit on it and the arms will stay down. This was actually a happy accident because now I know I can use one arm up and not the other if I want. There are varying positions of ""recline"" and each one locks into place and seems very sturdy. There are straps that keep this attached to the bleacher seat (but to be honest I rarely use these). When carrying this as a backpack it is comfortable and not as heavy as the previous model I had tried. Heating- I did not realize that you would need not only one but two battery banks in order to heat this so if you don't have those you will want to purchase them as well. These two battery banks will heat the two sections separately (seat and back). Luckily I will rarely need to use the heat on these so it isn't a huge concern for me, comfort is the bigger issue and this is well padded. Since I have a bad back and arthritis having the various positions helps me a lot especially if I have to sit for a long period. My biggest recommendation is to practice setting this up at home. It's not that it is difficult but there are little nuances you will want to figure out without an audience- for example clicking it in to the various positions (it reminds me of the lawn lounge chairs from the 80's in the way that it works) and making sure you know how the arms work.",4,27/11/2022 19:25,"KIMI HOUSE Double Heated Stadium Seats, Portable Heated Stadium Seat for Bleachers with 4 Pockets, 6 Reclining Positions Back and Arm Support for Sports Events, Outing, Travelling, Hiking",Sports_and_Outdoors,OR,
Maybe a good aid for indoor practice.,"Honestly I'm not quite sure what to make of this swing aid.  It does seem somewhat effective, but not a game changer.  I was looking for something I could swing a bit indoors and this fits the bill although you still need some room.  The grip is a training one that puts your hands in the right spot and this is a hefty aid that works your muscles a bit.  I do find the shape does help to keep me more on plane and the heavier weight helps with tempo.  Plane and tempo are always issues for me so I find this useful.  I don't know that this would really help with swing speed, but it does somewhat work your forearms so maybe.",3,27/10/2022 21:27,SKLZ Power Position Weighted Golf Swing Plane and Grip Trainer,Sports_and_Outdoors,OR,

The only bad thing, which is a non-starter for me, is that the battery is on the bottom of the unit.  This means to change it you have to take the sight of the firearm which will entail readjusting it.  I would suggest you look for one that has the batter on the top or in a tray that slides out to the side.",3,06/05/2022 18:31,"Red Dot Sight, Compact Reflex Sight Optics Gun Sights for Rifle Pistol Airsoft with Weaver Picatinny Rail for Hunting, Shooting",Sports_and_Outdoors,OR,

My cat loves it!!,"I have a lot more testing to do but here's what I've got so far. It does heat up fast and really toasty.  The highest setting is too warm for me even on a cold night. So the description says specifically to use the battery up and charge it again before using it. The directions actually specified charging it and emptying it five times. It says the battery won't last as long until you do this. It only lasted about three hours or so the first time I tried it and that was on the lower settings. So I have to try doing what they say and see if the battery life gets any better. The heating patches are on the underside of the bag. I thought for sure I would feel the wires and they would be uncomfortable but surprisingly they weren't an issue at all! The battery pack for the sleeping bag tucks in a pocket close to the zipper. It is on the right side of the bag. I thought for sure that would be uncomfortable too but it actually wasn't a problem. Although that might have been because I didn't move around at all because my cat crawled in the bag and I didn't want to disturb her. So my cat usually really dislikes being covered or closed in on anything. But she immediately got inside the bag and settled in. She didn't get out until the power got low. Cats are truly masters of comfort. So as long as the power was going, the bag kept me warm enough to be comfortable. But without the added electric heating I don't think this will be warm enough. The bag says 41° F and you'll be comfortable, and as low as 8.5°F and you'll stay alive. Well I tested it in above 41°F temperature and it would not have been warm enough without the heating elements turned on. Once the battery ran out I got out of the bag and under my pile of blankets. Now the lowest temperature setting is absolutely adequate and it is supposed to last for 6 to 9 hours. But considering it only lasted for about 3 hours last night I don't know if the battery will ever get to the promised 6 hours, even after following the instructions to improve the battery life. Only one night of heat isn't ideal. Half a night of heat is really unacceptable. Now this could have been so much more awesome. The problem is the plug used to connect the power bank to the sleeping bag. That plug is one of the round ones. But the voltage on this power bank is identical to my other power banks. If they had a USB plug in the bag I could just switch to a larger capacity power bank and this bag would be SO MUCH MORE USEFUL! I could just bring as many power banks as desired and stay warm for as many nights as I want. But the round plug keeps that from being a possibility. The power bank can be used to power other items. But since it is the only one that can power the bag, it must stay dedicated to the bag. Oh and another note, the control button and the power button emit light the entire time the bag is turned on. I wear a mask at night anyway, but the light is bright and might bother some folks. The three star rating is because the battery pack only lasts a few hours at first and it is yet to be determined if it will ever last even 6 hours. I can't trust it until then. The other reason is that the temperature rating is only accurate as long as the bag is powered, but it is definitely not warm enough by itself to keep me comfortable at the advertised 41°F. But it is comfortable material, well put together.",3,10/11/2022 01:12,ANTARCTICA GEAR Heated Sleeping Bag with 16000mAh 12V Battery Pack 5pcs Heating Areas Sleeping Bags for Adults 3 Adjustable Heating Levels Cold Weather Sleeping Bag for All Season Hiking & Camping,Sports_and_Outdoors,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SZW5GAHbL._SL1600_.jpg

Pickleball is tough but fun.  This set is great for beginners learning how to play.,"I used to play tennis in high school, and I loved it.  Over the years I've not played tennis nearly as much as I wanted to given work and life schedules.  Pickleball is something that I had heard of a couple of years ago but never really looked into it.  Now, it's the newest sports fad, and this set from Deerfamy is one that I ordered to get me back into something that is like tennis.  This set comes with two lightweight pickleball rackets, two indoor court (orange) and two outdoor court (yellow) balls.  There's also a carrying case that everything fits into. After my first attempt at playing pickleball, I have to say it's a tougher sport than I thought.  If you're familiar with tennis, there's a LOT of fast-paced volleying.  That was the part of tennis that I hated and the main reason I stayed back on the baseline.  I'm not a net player, but pickleball sort of forces you into that.  The equipment from Deerfamy was good at helping me practice.  It's lightweight and had a nice grip on the handle.  I had control of the racket when swinging, so I can't blame the racket.  I'm just not good at pickleball.... yet! :)",5,12/03/2023 03:58,"DEERFAMY Pickleball Paddles Set of 4, Best Pickleball Paddles for Beginners with 4 Premium Wood Rackets & 4 Pickleball Balls & 4 Cooling Towels& 1 Carry Bag &1 Racket Wipe, Gift for Men & Women",Sports_and_Outdoors,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VxVQ1y49L._SL1600_.jpg

Simple but effective,"Got this to extend my core training (I am not athlete, I sit most of the day and do regular exercise) and it is very enjoyable to use. While doing abs crunch is the main way to exercise your core efficiently, it does not activate the rest of the muscles around your mid section, and this device does exactly that. At first it feel impossible to get closer to the fully extended position, but after just few days I can do that without hitting my face on the floor. You can feel the tension on your abs, sides and back; and in part on your arms. Just be sure you orient the device correctly because it has a spring that helps to return to the upright position when unwind itself; if you use it backward it will actually slow you down and resist to the extend motion (which may be what you want?), up to a point where it won't go further and blocks your there. It won't give you 6 packs just by using it, so the assumption is that you are buying this to integrate your regular training regime and exercise routine; and for that it works great",5,30/09/2022 19:06,"Perfect Fitness Ab Carver Pro Roller Wheel With Built In Spring Resistance, At Home Core Workout Equipment, Red",Sports_and_Outdoors,OR,

Too sheer,"See image--see thru flag with recipient behind it. I guess I should have figured out that it was sheer (should I have known?) when it said in the description that the back side also showed the image...but I had no idea it would be so thin. My husband says, ""It uses less material! That means it is eco friendly!"" My son says, ""I don't want to hang a flag vertically in my room."" I say, ""You can still hang it horizontally, look you ca put thumb tacks on the right hand side!"" My son shakes his head. We thought about hanging it outside on our flagpole rather than in his room but it is so sheer I think the weather/wind would damage it rather quickly. Just as I was going to fold it up and set it to the side, my daughter said she'd take it. So that is good. If you want a super sheer, very light flag that will either hang off a wall using the canvas side with nails (or even tacks I bet) vertically, this is your flag. If you want to do the horizontal thing, you'll need extra tacks & will need to stick them thru the fabric on the right.

Very disappointed,"I purchased this item and immediately after delivery headed down to the beach. I don't understand. I ran up and down at the waters edge with this and my new Amazon whistle.

I even spelled out "" IM A GUARD"" in Morse code ( just in case some people were confused and perhaps question my authority. I did all this while holding up my new float the whole time! We'll, there was those few minutes that I was unconscious. I passed out from the Morse code but I do think I made a lot of people take notice (the code -not me passing out... I was given 7 free bottles of water though by all the nice people there when I woke up) ). When came to I jumped up and waved this float hard...  like the time I was attacked by bees  and fought them off with pool noodle (only stung 87 times).  Still nobody paid attention to me. The float  says ""guard"" but they still ignored me. I think the ""Guard"" font may be too small. All people did was point in my direction and laugh. Some people even threw sand at me. It's okay though because  it's pretty obvious that they couldn't see ""guard"" because of the small font  and my terrible whistle (see next review) clearly was not loud enough at all.

If it's your only light source,  it will do the job. We use solar string lights around our campsites as primary lighting.  These are good when you need something extra. They have a handy flashlight type of light that will lead the path ahead of you.  Lots of hanging options, which is super cool and useful. I came back with all 4 of them from this camping trip.

Executed well for what you get,"There are many ways to start a fire.  I didn't make it to Eagle Scout, so I lack some of the basic skills. :-) What I can say is this flint and striker set is designed well for what it does.  I have not had extensive use of this product, so I can't speak to longevity/durability, but I can note the following: - Ergonomic, which is helpful for ease of use.  I have average size hands, long-ish fingers, and good dexterity.  I found it easy to hold and execute a good spark. - Hi-viz cord, something I wish more mfrs would do.  A plus when it's dark or low light conditions. One thing I will say is while it is not ""heavy"", it is heavier than I would like.  I have a magnesium block and striker and they are about half the weight of this product.  The mag-block is a little more involved because you are shaving the block for your ""starter"" (not easy), so it's fire starter and spark all in one.  I can't say if this product allows you to use the shavings as your ""starter"", but it is MUCH easier to use than the mag-block starter I have. Assuming I don't encounter issues with product failure (e.g. handle falls off), this product will work well for my purposes.",4,05/11/2022 03:30,"Flint & Steel Ferro Rod Fire Starter with Fluorescent Paracord - Striker Survival Kit - Magnesium 3/8” (9mm) Diameter, 10,000 Strikes for Emergency, Camping, Bushcraft",Sports_and_Outdoors,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xLj+IGQNL._SL1600_.jpg

Sturdy enough for daily use. Good resistance adjustments. Could be quieter.,Overall this trainer is very decent for its price. Good: * Sturdy. * Very stable after properly leveling the stand. * The 6-level resistance combined with the drivetrain on my bike gives me virtually any resistance level I want. Bad: * The paint comes off easily when in contact with lubricant / alcohol. * It gets really loud (clicking noise) past a certain RPM threshold. This can be remedied with setting the resistance to maximum and use the bike's gears to adjust the resistance.,4,03/04/2022 07:39,Bike Trainer Stand Indoor Cycling - Sportneer Magnetic Bicycle Exercise Stand with Noise Reduction Wheel (Red),Sports_and_Outdoors,OR,
There is no pump,"Very simple instructions on where and how to use the ""pump"". It seems more like a air cavity with a one way valve.

I was surprised at how fast it does inflate using only my lungs, but I went with this more expensive option  because it was advertised with a pump integrated into it! Very disappointing.

"Fantastic unit, fantastic customer service","My wife and I recently purchased three sets (in two different orders), and can say these are, without doubt, the best hose sprayer and shower attachments we have ever used. We own a small residential construction business, with commercial accounts at Home Depot and Lowe's, have substantial familiarity with most every plumbing-related matter, and find these units to be solidly constructed and a pleasure to install and use. *** The sets come with adapters for virtually every setup, and we have been able to install one on our jacuzzi without a problem, and two others on showers. *** The water flow from the shower heads appears to be 2.5 gallons per minute (gpm), which is fabulous, compared to the typical 1.75gpm mandated by the US EPA. *** Importantly, when I found that none of the adapters fit for connection to my shower supply, I had occasion to have a series of emails with Camy of Klleyna, who was wonderfully responsive throughout. I truly can't remember the last time I had such amazingly responsive customer service associated with a purchase on Amazon. *** Although this review may seem like a paid infomercial, please note that I have not been paid for this review, I paid full price for these sets, and I would be delighted to pay full price again—which price, by the way, is ridiculously low!",5,03/11/2022 16:19,"138"" Shower Hose Replacement Extension - Klleyna Extra Long Flexible hose for Handheld Shower Head, Bathtub Faucet Hose Attachment, Stainless Steel Pipe, RV,Bathroom Cleaning Bidet Sprayer,Lightweight",Tools_and_Home_Improvement,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MgL-+ACRL._SL1600_.jpg

Overall, these have met expectations and that's a hard sell for me in some categories, of which this is one. Recommendation: These are very sturdy brackets. Well beyond TV level. I'm using one in my garage for extension cord management.

Great to practice and pretty when completed!,"[[VIDEOID:b76021d5fc3e48c814b80282c7e87277]] I started with the blue board and did some with solder paste/hot air and some with an iron.

The inside part is a classic counter showing clock, counting, and the carry out function of the counter. I learned that the carry function resets at 5, not as I expected!

The best lamps ever!,I love everything about these lamps! They were easy to put together although I've never had to build a lamp shade it was pretty easy. There is a black piece on the lamp where you screw the light bulb in that you take off and put over the lamp shade to keep it in place. It took me a little while to figure out how to keep it sturdy and not so wobbly but that did the trick. They are beautiful high quality lamps and I absolutely LOVE the touch function! We have a newborn and it's great to be able to reach over and touch the light to turn it on and off instead of fumbling around. I also love the it has different levels of light. The more you touch it the brighter it gets until you reach the brightest and then it turns off. Overall very impressed with these! Get some! I also want to add that it has a USB port and a USB c port on the lamp! How cool is that!

Repeat offender,"This is probably the 3rd time I order these. While there's brighter stuff out there (like HMCITY 120 LED), which I have; these lights have lasted a lifetime. The motion sensor feature is amazing,  as opposed to the ones I mentioned, that you literally have to be under them. I have about 4 of these where the sensor light and light cover is busted (after hurricane Maria, I live in PR) and they are still working in amazingly long distances!!! I had them nailed to palm trees, but moved to fence and secured them with zip ties. The motion sensor feature and durability are just something else!!! It's been raining this week, so submitting pictures wouldn't do them justice, but I will update. It would be amazing if they added additional lights, but for the price; it doesn't get any better. Some of my newer HMCITY, while bright haven't lasted longer than a year or 2. They are still great and have great reviews; but based on experience,  these are lifelong keepers. Some are totally busted and inflated (water, rust, exposure, time) and they still work and light up from about 20 feet distance. I live in a farm, now I just fasten them with ""bubble gum"", something a teacher talked to me about. It's chewy, very durable, easy to install and can be removed easily without tears or stains.

The tire rests on two thin metal blades,"This is a low-quality stand. I do not like how the tires rest in the holding area because the thin metal puts all the weight pressure of the bike into two small areas of the tires. The tires are indented where it touches the thin metal. They should disperse the pressure over a wider area. The better-selling Bike Nook product is an example of a stand with better weight dispersal. All the marketing photos have the front wheel sticking straight up. In reality, the front wheel will completely rotate to one side unless you use the velcro strap, which is awkward to attach. The assembly instructions are bad for such an easy assembly.

"Driver is slippery, worse if you hands have any oils at all.","I wanted to like it, but I just can't. Case: The case is nice, it has magnetic sides, though I wish it was a trifold of some sort, as the sides fall off easily. This could be remedies with better magnets. Currently the design of the case while ""cool"" is not very functional. No place for the drive to be protected, see driver below for more. The drive resides in a plastic tube with two rubber plugs. If you lose any of these 3 parts, the drive can not longer be secured. There is no room for the charging cable, and no room for the accessories even the base model comes with. The bit holders are fantastic and should be a model for all other companies. The case has no markings for bit size Bits: So far they seem fantastic, it listed them as magnetic, but I haven't found any that are magnetic on their own. You must use the tool on any bit you want to be magnetic, I found it wore off within 5 minutes and frankly was a bit sad. Bits should be marked clearer, with white enamel paint inside the engraved text. or apply lettering to the case to easily see the size. Driver: Super smooth driver with no grip, high initial torque, enough it can fly out of your hands, or spin small devices out of your opposite hand. There should be some texture or rubberized material to reduce this. Overall there is little power to this driver, screws with heads designed to seat into a enclosures such as hard drive screws, it can barely turn them. Driver also has no protection against pushing both buttons, a simple xor gate would have fixed this. it can be one or the other, not both. This driver has no such luxuries, so hopefully it does not get stuck in your pocket, or something presses against the plastic tube that protects it. Lightly pressing on the tube sides cause it to turn on, if you don't catch it, it will burn up the driver. I thought maybe I could face the buttons to the case to protect them, but lightly pressing still activates it. Final thoughts: It also comes with a small magnetic worktable, sadly it is black and screws are hard to see on it. There is no place on the plastic case for it to even stick too. just another accessory to carry around lose, just like the magnetizing tool, and cable. The case has a giant lettering of CS0233 on it, which is just ugly, and means little to nothing, it also has an even bigger 56+1 with a picture of a bit, again pointless the opposite has a giant logo and a screw and spring on it. The lack of protection on pushing both buttons, the weird out of case holder for the driver that only works if you have 3 pieces to combine is just a bad design. The case could be trifold to protect all bits from falling out, and protect the driver. Case could also use an internal battery you can plug the whole case in with a retractable cable, and dock style charging to the driver. This product is a big expensive for the lack of any decent features. Aliexpress has provided us with much better for a fraction of the cost, and only a small loss in quality.",3,14/01/2023 01:48,"PKEY Electric Screwdriver, Electric Screwdriver Set with 55 Magnetic Precision Bit, Type-C Rechargeable 260mAh Battery, 3 LED Light, Cordless Electric Screwdriver for PC Building, Electronics, Watch",Tools_and_Home_Improvement,OR,

Just got it this morning,"*UPDATE* Delivered Aug 2nd. Today is Aug 11. It will not turn on tonight. I plugged it in and the little light on the front will not turn on to say charging. Shame. I really liked this product. Cannot return cuz threw box away. I wouldn't be upset if it lasted at least a month (for only $6) but dying 2 weeks later, shame. It goes very warm bright to barely on which is what I wanted besides changing to color mode. The instructions are not clear on how to make it change colors. After 30 min of being frustrated, reading what written directions there were, and trying the different taps, I re-looked at it on here thinking maybe I ordered one that didn't change color. Then I saw the video on here and saw the person do something on the bottom to make it change color. The video is dark so I have no idea what she did so I just pressed and double pressed ""places"" on the bottom. It changed color! Ask me to do it again and I'll have no clue what exactly I did to initially change it. So do yourself a favor and watch the video on here. Other than all that, Im satisfied with this for the price.

For Very Small Fasteners,"I got this screwdriver set to replace an existing one that was cheaply made and had a clumsy case. This set is much much better - but for extremely small fasteners. Think of the screws holding your glasses or sunglasses together. That's the largest size. The screwdrivers all get smaller than that. Seriously, you'll need a jeweler's loupe to see what these are designed to be used on. That being said, this is a well-designed and executed screwdriver set. Pros:  - Every tip has its own handle, so there's no swapping out tips in a common handle.  - The grips on the handles are big enough for easy use, yet not so big they get in your way.  - There is a swivel opposite the tip end so that you can easily push down and twist with your fingertips, when this works (see below).  - Each type of screwdriver has its own color code and each has its size clearly marked on the handle.  - The case is soft, well designed and closes with Velcro. Fairly easy to removed and return the tools.  - The bonus tools are a nice addition:   - A magnetic loop to keep the tips magnetized if you want.   - A non-metallic probe with a pointy and a flat end to manipulate small parts.   - An extremely precise pair of tweezers. These could easily pick up a single grain of salt. I separated the tweezers in my photo so you can see how tiny the tips are. Needle-sharp, so they really need the included plastic tip protector. Cons: (I took off one star because the screwdriver set is not quite perfect)  - Some swivels (see above) turn easily and some have a lot of friction.  - One of the star screwdrivers arrived with a bent tip.  - You need to struggle with the elastic loops holding the screwdrivers in the case to insert the tools. Overall, this is a fine precision screwdriver set for teeny tiny fasteners, well worth the price.",4,19/08/2022 19:19,"OPOW 19-Piece Precision Screwdriver Set with Pouch, Phillips, Slotted, Pentalobe Torx Star for PC, Laptop, Phone, Camera, Eyeglass, Watch, Toys, Non-Slip Grip, Magnetic Small Screwdrivers set",Tools_and_Home_Improvement,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Clr1vdbSL._SL1600_.jpg

Good for basic household jobs,"This drill is setup and used like most other drills. There is nothing fancy about it, and it has a decent weight to it. The only thing it comes with is the battery and charger, so any drill bits you need, will have to be ordered separately. It works just fine for household tasks, but it does seem to struggle to do anything that takes a little force. Even trying to screw into straight sheet rock it seized and made that infamous grinding sound all drills make when hitting anything too hard. I am not sure why, but I will note, I did not charge this drill before testing it, and I do know a weaker battery can be part of your problem. Still, I do not expect this to be able to do anything bigger than household tasks. This lost a star because of that. For the price this is, I have gotten drills that were better equipped for harder jobs, and also came with the drill bits. But, I am definitely not saying this is a waste of money either. I still have not fully tried this out, but I do believe it will meet the criteria of a decent 4 star drill. Not perfect or the best, but still a useful tool to have. I would definitely consider purchasing again, but only time will tell whether it will be a lasting drill. If I decide it is better than a 4 star I will update my review, as well as updating if it falls below a 4 star. All in all, a decent drill.

These are great just wish there were more vacuum bags included.,"I am a huge fan of vacuum bags! And these are really nice ones. Just wish there were more. It came 4 cloth zipper storage bins with handles which are nice & sturdy and 4 vacuum seal bags (which are nice sealing and good quality). I think depending on what you put in these bags you could easily get 3 vacuumed down bags in one of the cloth zipper storing bins possibly even 4. I used 2 vacuum bags and one of the cloth bins for all my summer pool towels which are pretty good size. And I had plenty of room within the cloth zipper bin for more items which I did put more towels and rugs in it as well. I like that you can keep things (like summer/pool things in this case) all together within the zipper bin. It wouldn't fit under my bed too tall. But it fit nicely in the back of my linen closet stored away until next summer. I'm using the other two raining vacuum bags for seasonal decorative blankets to store away until needed. I will need to order more vacuum bags for the remaining cloth bins. You could just use the cloth zipper bins without the vacuum bags they are nice a roomy and hold quite a bit. Which I may use for random pillows and stuffed animals. I really like the clear window to view what's inside it's a nice perk. I can't say enough about the vacuum bags. There are good ones and not so good ones and these are really a nice quality one. They seal really easily, no struggling to get it to seal and they stay sealed. It's the only reason I took off a star was there just aren't enough included with the amount of zipper bins that hold 2 each.",4,23/09/2022 23:19,LOKNGXU Cube Vacuum Storage Bags Save Storage Space Bedroom Organization Quilts Blankets Clothes Storage Vacuum Seal Bags (Large 4 sets),Tools_and_Home_Improvement,OR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y4o6-9onL._SL1600_.jpg

"Sharp, sturdy pull saw","This Japanese-style pull saw has a grippy handle that holds a 7"" blade that's removable and replaceable. Removing the blade also allows for more compact storage. The blade is thin and flexible, but sturdy, and has a hole at the end for hanging. One edge has 18 teeth to the inch, which allows for smooth, fine cuts, and the other, coarser edge rips through wood more quickly; I usually start the cut with the fine edge.  The teeth on both edges each have three faces, making them very sharp and effective.  The only possible downside I've found is that some pull saws have longer blades, which allow longer pulls, but can also be a little more unwieldy.

"Generally good, not great.","The good news is that it generally works. That's nice. The bad news is that the construction and mechanics feel significantly cheaper than the other wyze lock. Granted it is half the price. Other negatives is the keypad is directly attached to the internals, which seems less than secure. And you need to replace your entire deadbolt. And there's no key backup option. And the install takes way longer. And the finger printer reader is not great at fingerprint recognition. And I'd probably not use it outdoors where cold, hot, rain, and snow exist. I can see a few cases where you'd use this over the WyzeLock+keypad. However in most cases this is not the smart lock you want. For indoor uses like say for a closet, or a basement, or such, this is fine and cheaper. For a shed probably ok.

Recently I used it to light up my bedroom after a power outage hit our neighborhood during the peak of monsoon season. I was glad that I had this lantern. The warm light mode is awesome and makes this worth a buy 100% as I really dislike the blue tinted led lanterns out there. One thing I'd criticize is the decision to not have the charging port work for power delivery as well so that someone could charge their phone or tablet with the lantern.

Cute but face cutouts really too small for adults,This was purchased to use as a photo drop. It is a fairly thin material much like a trash bag so not super easy to rip but also has no weight to it to keep it from flying around where it's not taped down. The colors are vibrant and it was a fun addition to the party. The only negative is the holes to put your face in are really too small for an adult so instead of taking pics with the face 'in' the space you have to put your face up to it which takes away a bit but we still had fun with it.

break easily and there is no possible way to use one to pick up a fork as shown in demo,I'm on my second package. Thinking I broke all the ones in the first packet from poor skills. Which was partially my fault many of the first times these loops broke from mishandling. But they are also breaking from doing the example tricks on the video. This product is cool but gets one star because there is no way you are moving a fork with these things. And there is definitely no way to use them to make a fork spin on a bottle which is another advertised trick for these. The idea that the string could send enough force when snapped on a fork to get it to spin on top of a bottle is ludicrous. So I don't like what seems to be deceptive advertising. BUT ... Here's the thing though even though I keep breaking it. I keep buying more ... I love when the effect works. but this is getting expensive,1,08/10/2022 04:22,Loops New Generation (Set of 8) by Yigal Mesika,Toys_and_Games,OR,

Best lightsaber toy I've ever owned,"[[VIDEOID:1d39f271bba36f57dd813f1f7e606e8c]] This lightsaber is fun and does just about everything. You can change the color of the blade to a near endless number of colors. There's 12 different sets of sound effects.  I tried them all out and like ""The Dark Lord"" the best.  To me, this one has the clearest and most pronounced sets of sound effects and they inspire the most nostalgia for me as they remind me of some of the most memorable light saber battles in Star Wars.  There are other effects that remind you of different parts of the movie (the sounds are very different when Luke is dueling the remote on the Falcon vs. when he is in combat with Vader).  Effects from ""The High Ground"", ""The Second"", and ""The Count"" all sound closer to what you hear on the Falcon.  The Dark Lord sounds closer to what you hear in Return of the Jedi during that epic Vader fight. There's a range of settings to control sound effects from just swinging the saber to what it does on impact/clash, and the effects you hear when it first turns on or when you turn it back off again.  The button on several sets uses various blaster sounds or blaster sounds being blocked by a light saber.  This changes in each sound effect set.  There are settings to control color, volume, and what happens with certain motions.  I love the 'twist to turn on' and 'twist to turn' off motion effect.  Not only is that effect faster and more convenient, but it also keeps you from accidentally tampering with the button and unintentionally changing a setting. They put a lot of effort into giving you the ability to control a wide range of settings using just 1 button.  It took me a second to get used to that, but if you've read the directions, it's a very easy thing to get used to.  Each button duration corresponds to a number of flashes of light from the ring shaped light around the button.  On your first read through, you see a list of options that you access by holding the button down for 0.5 seconds, 1 second, 1.5 seconds, etc... and think that's going to be really difficult to select, but you can ignore all that and just hold it down and count the number of flashes you're supposed to wait to access that setting.  Once you do it a few times, you'll be flying through the settings menu really quickly.  This is a very robust saber. In addition to all that, the saber feels very durable.  The 'blade' if you will is a sort of hard plastic (not at all brittle, though).  That said, I wouldn't go smacking it into bricks or rocks.  You can scratch it up and damage it if you really try, but for cosplay, LARP, etc... it'll do just fine as long as you aren't slamming it around. The hilt is heavy and durable.  The craftsmanship of the hilt is really good.  The whole thing feels like a high end, high quality movie prop. This is a very fun toy and would make an excellent gift to any Star Wars fan.  It's also the perfect addition to any light saber wielding cosplayer.  I'm very happy to have this.",5,02/09/2022 23:21,"Motion Control Light Saber Smooth Swing Dueling Light Sabers - 12 Colors Changeable RGB Light Saber, 12 Sound Fonts Light-Saber for Adults Teens Kids Cosplay, 44in Long",Toys_and_Games,OR,

WOOD SUDOKU BOARD GAME SET,"I have owned an identical unit for a few months and love it. In order to play the game while sitting on the recliner, I placed it inside a box cover--big enough to include a smaller box to keep the tiles. That left the game drawer to store the tiny tiles (guess numbers)  I bought separately inside the tray. Since I have played the game for years, I usually work on the games with less than 25 given numbers and some can be really difficult. And yes, so far I have found just one number appearing twice in the same row.  No problem. At times I use the X-Sudoku book or any of the other paperbacks. I made a black cardboard cover to protect a game-in-progress and hold it in place with a long piece of Velcro around it. The box and tile measurements are just fine as per the ad. I am buying this unit as a gift for a friend who just took a liking to the game.",5,01/01/2023 23:26,"Hey! Play!

Fun and Educational Toy,"Our grandson attends a Montessori daycare, so he is very comfortable and familiar with this type of toy. This is really a neat little educational toy, with many wooden parts in various colors and geometric shapes that stack on a base with differing numbers of wooden pegs (1 to 5).  The round pieces have one center hole and fit on the single peg, the rectangular pieces have two holes and fit on the two pegs, and so on.  So, toddlers are learning to manipulate objects, identify geometric shapes and colors, and even count while playing with these.  The pieces seem too large to swallow, but the toy is recommended for ages 1-3, and I wouldn't suggest allowing younger children to play with it.",5,02/03/2023 21:24,"kecristv Montessori Toys for 1 2 Year Old Boy and Girl, Wooden Sorting & Stacking Toys for Toddlers 1-3，Toddler Toys Gifts for 1 2 3 Year Old Boys Girls, Shape Sorter and Color Stacker Preschool Toys",Toys_and_Games,OR,

The difference in the originals is amazing! Love everything about it. True they will kill batteries in no time but did some research and its more if you use the camera a lot.
