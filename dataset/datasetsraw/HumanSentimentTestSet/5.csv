"Pro Tip, check research the tv's VESA layout before you buy it and find a matching mount if you are buying for a RV/Travel Trailer. I bought a nice tv from costco, but it had a very uncommon vesa layout and could not find a decent mount, even a non articulating one (would have been fine with a fixed one, actually would have preferred). Ended up returning it and going with a different tv that had a more common vesa layout. I went with this mount because you can only use two screws in a vertical line, who knows whats behind the sheeting in a travel trailer so i didn't want to have to go with a wide multi stud mount.  this one fit the bill and works perfectly.",5,CG
Really liked this camera except it was a little too small for my fingers to operate. I didn't have it more than a month or two when i loaned it to my grandson & he managed to lose it.

"Perhaps I misread the description, but I was under the impression that this included multiple items unicorn related.  Instead there is one unicorn board game and one small, simple book.  These are good items, just not as much as I expected.  The plurals in the titles implied multiple games, books, activities.  Anyway, moving on, the board game looks ok but has not been tested yet by my grandchildren. If it is not satisfactory, I will update later.  The book is simple for them to read and appears attractive with appealing  illustrations, but will not keep their attention for long.  I'm just hopeful the game engages them.",4,OR

It's very easy to insert and close the charger. You can use the cable as a micro USB cable, or just plug it into a wall outlet.

"1984 by George Orwell is a novel, with a distinctively dystopian plot that makes the reader feel as if they are the protagonists. The characters are complex, and the plots are very interesting.  The novel is in many ways a reflection of the American political scene. Its almost eerie, and a bit depressing at times, and it is a great way to introduce a new generation of readers to the subject matter of dystopian literature. But the novel is also an interesting introduction to a new generation of readers to dystopian literature. The novel is a fun, quirky read, with plenty of twists and turns.

"I purchased one of these at Wal-Mart for $10.00. In my 50's now I always wanted to have one. I don't know why some people had issues or put it down. First off I sent for the ants which cost another $5.00 for S&H right through the website. It took 10 days to receive them, keep in mind if you live somewhere it's cold or too hot you will wait longer. After receiving the ants, only one dead one, I followed the instructions closely. First making 4 starter tunnles with the tool and then cooling down the ants in the fridge for 15 minutes then putting them in. It took less the 24 hours and the ants started working. Each ant has different jobs. Some dig, some remove debris and some just stand guard near the lid. Someone reviewed it didn't light up well; maybe they didn't put batteries in it! Mine lighted up well! The only hard part to this is the fact you have to put the whole farm in the refrigerator for at least 75 minutes to slow the ants up to clean out the debris as they are very fast and will try to escape. I have it 3 weeks so far and lost maybe 5 ants as they do die off and do not lay eggs since there is no queen. Like any other creature sometimes they dig other times they rest.  I do believe its fun to watch and well worth the 10 bucks. I guess I'm a kid at heart, get one and enjoy the fun!",4,OR
"Comfort is very important as you get older, especially as things begin to ache and hurt. And since sleep has eluded me for several years, I have found that it is the quality of the rest, not necessarily the quantity of rest that is important. This Ichrysania bamboo body pillow is soft, fluffy and plush.  I love the quilted design.  You can cuddle with it, read a book on it or watch TV. You can unzip the body to remove or add filling. I selected the gray one that I thought would not show dirt, but will probably order a cover. And finally, this pillow is machine washable. Overall, this is a welcomed addition to my relaxation regime.",4,OR

I bought this to replace my 30 year old single speed Dremel.  WOW!  Shouldn't have waited so long.  All the attachments really make DIY home improvement so much easier.  So much fun to use that after I'd had it for a while I found myself looking for ways to use some of the attachments I hadn't yet needed.  The only thing that's not so great is it seems to be in a box meant for more than one model - so there are molded places to put things that aren't included.  That takes up space in the box that could be better used to store what DOES come inside & would make it easier to put stuff away.,5,OR
"Macy is bored of all the pitiful looks she receives due to her fathers death a year earlier. She and her mother have been getting along fine, just fine, on their own. Her mother constantly works, and Macy helps her by sticking to their routine and keeping a perfectly clean house. Shes content with her perfect boyfriend and perfect grades and perfect life. That is, until a hectic catering company enlists her help at one of her mothers work parties. She then realizes how exciting chaos can be and how interesting real friends are. I read this book for my Read-a-Thon at school and I finished it in the day. It contains some serious issues, but overall its an airy read. The issues aren't heart-wrenching nor are they abnormal, so the book is easy to relate to. I could complain about its predictability or sappiness, but The Truth about Forever is defintely a book about the journey. It doesnt matter that the reader knows within the first chapter that Macy will fall for the gorgeous catering guy, Wes. Or that the book will have pages about finding yourself, realizing happiness, and moving on. I knew coming into the novel this wasn't a heavy book, which is why I enjoyed it. Its entertaining, and thats why I like Dessens books. Always, she writes books that serve to entertain and relate to teens. I flipped happily through the pages, never bored, but never thrilled either. The characters are fun and normal and don't have anything special about them. Her books are so realistic. The world isn't going to end and the characters don't have anything life altering happen to them. She somehow writes about ordinary days but still engages the reader wholeheartedly. The Truth about Forever is a cute romance between two teens trying to find themselves. The plot isn't extraordinary, but the writing style and characters really make the book. Compared to the other Dessen books Ive read, this one isn't as good, but I still found myself entertained while reading it. More book reviews at Stealingpages.",3,CG

"This review is for Prince Harry: I loved your book, it made me cry, it made me laugh, but mostly made me very sad. You've been trying so hard for so long to find the TRUTH, but looking in all the wrong places. I can say this Harry because I'm a nobody, average American living in Florida, nearly twice your age and with years of ""Inner Healing"" experience: Harry, you need a SOZO. You are dealing with unresolved trauma that may have even begun in vitro. And Harry, you can be healed once and for all, set free to live your life as God intended. This is not counseling, this is inner healing ministry and you are living in the perfect place, where Bethel Sozo began (see ""bethelsozo.com"") in 1997. Interesting coincidence? The word SOZO is Greek and is used 110 times in the New Testament and it means to ""MAKE WHOLE"", also to save, deliver, heal and preserve. Unresolved Trauma creates walls, divisions and segmentation in your life, that is why parts of your memory just disappear. SOZO uncovers these traumas and other injuries caused by the lies we have believed and replaces them with the TRUTH. There is only one source of truth and only He can set you free and make you ""Complete"". Your Grandmother had a very special relationship with our Creator and her Reign reflects those blessings poured out on the House of Windsor and all of Britain because of that relationship. Was she perfect? no. Did she make mistakes? of course, she was human. But I believe God has spoken and put His arms around Queen Elizabeth ll and said ""job well done, My good and faithful servant"". Her Monarchy is over, but Harry you've just begun and have much to do to fulfill your destiny. I pray that Father God would guide your heart in it's search for Truth, that you may be ""Made Whole"" and available to continue your service to Him. Harry, be so blessed!",5,OR

"This is an excellent documentary about Allen's entire career.  There are many, many film clips and they are all choice highlights from his films.  Interspersed with these clips are interview segments with Allen present day and during earlier days.  There are also clips of mini interviews with the people with whom he has worked, including Tony Roberts, Diane Keaton, Scarlett Johannsen, John Cusack, Owen Wilson, Mariel Hemingway, Gordon Willis, Marshall Brickmann, Martin Scorsese, his sister Letty Aronson, now his producer, Dick Cavett and so forth.  Although Mia Farrow is covered, she does not participate in any way since they have never resumed contact in any way. She was, of course, Allen's other major leading lady but he ended up having an affair and marrying her adopted daughter years ago.  Even though I have seen every single one of his movies, I really liked the choice of film clips presented here.  It was very enjoyable to see them and to learn some of the tidbits about what else was going on while making them.  Everyone contributed some major insight about the film clip which was unknown to us before.  I also enjoyed the way he present day took us to his old school or walked down the street with his sister and they talked to present New Yorkers.  There was even old footage shown of his parents who finally died near the century mark.  Although the focus was on the work, there was enough of a human dimension presented here to make this a very important summing up of a creative life while the creator is still around to share it.

"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Double Fudge"". . . This book once again focuses on the book's main character Farley Drexel Hatcher (B.K.A. ""Fudge""). He is absolutely hilarious in this book. His obsession with money, his twin cousins and their little brother nicknamed ""Mini"", along with their parents are another interesting twist in this story. Peter Hatcher, Fudge's  older brother, who is now an official ""junior high school student"",  typically experiences all of the anxiety that is associated with  early adolesence. This book made me laugh and laugh, especially the reaction of Mr. Hatcher when he discovers that their his cousins  want to stay at their house longer than a week. I was also able to put myself in  many of the situations and generally grasp a feel each of the characters. The first book that I ever read in the Fudge series was ""Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing"" followed by ""Superfudge"". I can remember attending Jefferson Elementary School in Little Rock, Arkansas waiting in line for what seemed like an infinity, to have first bid on checking out that book. I became a ""reader beaver"" thanks to Judy Blume and the wonderful staff at Jefferson Elementary who encouraged all students to build their foundation through reading. I used to walk swifly through the library with the rest of my classmates running straight towards the ""B"" fiction section --shouting, ""Ready or not here I come."" This is an excellent read, and it is authors like Judy Blume who grasp the interest of young readers by  making her work interesting and identifiable to young readers.

Overall this trainer is very decent for its price. Good: * Sturdy. * Very stable after properly leveling the stand. * The 6-level resistance combined with the drivetrain on my bike gives me virtually any resistance level I want. Bad: * The paint comes off easily when in contact with lubricant / alcohol. * It gets really loud (clicking noise) past a certain RPM threshold. This can be remedied with setting the resistance to maximum and use the bike's gears to adjust the resistance.,4,OR

"Want to know the bane of an electric car?  I will say that it's a pretty good electric car.  The motor is solid and takes the guesswork out of how much power it needs.  It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use and I thought the gift feature was a good feature.  I gave it to my friend and she loved it.  It is very cute and I really like that it has a drawstring that can be used to hang it on the wall.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a very strong, compact",5,OR

"It is incredibly annoying to get it to turn on, and sometimes it just won't. I frequently have to unplug and plug back in every chord related to the device in hopes it will start working. It is EXTREMELY inconsistent. Plus it needs to be calibrated every single time I turn on the computer. It works great when it works, but the user experience is so frustrating that I couldn't recommend it. IMPORTANT: the HDMI chord also takes up the two other display ports to the sides of it, so it doesn't really work with a 3 monitor set up either (I used a knife to shave one of my display port heads, which BARELY managed to fit next to their ultra-wide headed HDMI). I also wish the screen was a little more matte for a better drawing texture, but I still prefer it over other matte screens like the Wacom 24 4k as it doesn't have that grainy prismatic color effect like those due to the screen's rough physical texture.",2,CG

"My husband loves to play his video games, unfortunately the couch is to far from the tv for him to play and was wanting some type of bean bag to use while playing. The chill bag bean bag is perfect!! Unlike normal bean bags this one is filled with little pieces of memory foam. The memory foam makes it extra comfy. It's 4 ft size and it easily fits my husband and my 4 year old. It comes in a medium size box and I wasn't expecting it to be in such a small box considering its size, the memory foam is condensed into a ball with plastic wrap around it, and the cover is seperate. Me and my two kids followed the instructions and carefully unwrapped the memory foam, once we got it out of the plastic wrap, I had the kids jump on it to loosen the memory foam and it quickly expanded. This bean bag is very sturdy and actually kinda heavy. You sink right into it and since it has memory foam instead of the tiny foam balls you can conform it to how your sitting. We love this ""bean bag"" !! When my husband isn't playing his video games and using it my kids are, it's a big hit at our house.

The quality of the T-shirt is a cotton and spandex combo- great in my opinion. Love the grayish tie die look and the flower prying and color is exactly as pictured. This dress took over a week to arrive and I recommend sizing up one size. My daughter is a very short 9 year old so I assumed the 9-10 yrs size would give her some room to grow into and be longer in length as the little girl pictured in the advertisement but it fit her just right which means she will grow out of it in a few months or after a few washes (will update in future if the dress does in fact shrink) I personally recommend sizing up to the next size which would be 11-12 yrs I’m my case,5,CG

This radio was being endorsed by our local TV Weather channels as being the top of line and promoting them at various stores in our area. Found out that amazon had this same radio for almost $15 less then what was being offered at the store so bought it. It is very easy to program and set up for any area where you might live and since it comes with a battery back up for power outages discovered we could take it with us for those one day trips for shopping,etc. It works extremely well and recommend it to any one who is weather concerned, mostly for severe storms like tornados.

"I love this collar! I chose it specifically for the buckle. It's so much easier than the ones that slip over the dog's head. The buckle feels strong and secure, even when it isn't locked. The plastic feels thick enough that it won't weaken over time. It feels like quality material in general. The color was as pictured and it looks really nice. I'm also a huge fan of the tag loop! It's so much easier to get those little key rings on that than with a traditional D ring. This collar passed the ultimate test when my dog crawled under a parked car two days after the collar arrived. She and the collar came out covered in grease and dirt.

This is by far my favorite version of Beauty and the Beast. I like that the family love one another instead of the usual not so loving family that frequently is written of.

When I bought it the flow was way too strong for my 10gal sponge filter so I used a control valve to slow the release of air and after about a week the whole thing just stopped working.

I would recommend you don’t buy unless you want a really powerful flow of air bc a control vale seemed to break the whole thing,2,CG

"I was very disappointed to find that there is NO Vimeo app available, as it has been for previous models.  I am hoping this is just a temporary issue since this model just hit the market.  Unfortunately the answers from Sony are pretty much ""...thanks for asking, no details,...wait and see...""  Therefore, I would not recommend this player if you need Vimeo.  *** three month update *** Still no Vimeo! No response from Sony support or user sites. Not good.  With moderate use, we have found that it does not crash as frequently as the previous year's model. So we don't have to pull the plug quite as often. Yes, there is no other re-boot or recovery option other than pulling the plug. Not good.  Rating now downgraded to two stars.  My advice: forget Blu-Ray, get Roku, absolutely top-notch engineering and solid software. Streaming support is blazing fast, no startup lag, quality just as good as the Sony.

It wasn't difficult to see that Kevin had a serious behavioural problem early on, as a viewer it was quite clear.  However, as a parent it would be very difficult to admit your child had little or no conscience  at all and was capable of committing such heinous acts.  My heart went out to Tilda Swinton for trying to deal with a child she realized had serious problems, with no one to turn to for help or guidance, it was quite hopeless.  I got the feeling from the start of her pregnancy and after the birth she never seemed happy about motherhood.  The question presents itself.

"Up to now, the only things Bill O'Reilly have ever been good at are weak-minded thought manipulation and noise pollution, but now he has another box to tick off on his resume: he can write humor. Unintentional humor, that is. You see, the garbage that is ""The No-Spin Zone: Confrontations with the Powerful and Famous in America"" proves that even on the page, Bill O'Reilly shines through as a complete hypocrite, and a horrible, horrible writer. It's so bad it's funny. Or it would be funny if people didn't actually listen to and believe this man.  You can see it in print as clearly as on his shows: this guy pulls words out of the mouths of the people he interviews; he bullies them with his stupid questions that are engineered to cater to his own views... And he is never after the truth, because the truth is a gray area and he only sees in black and white. Because he grew up rich and went to a boys' private Catholic school, he likes to think of himself as some kind of supreme arbiter over everyone. People like him are the reason many people think of the USA a ""bratty teenager of a country"". If you are looking for a book that is ""Fair and balanced"", this is most definitely not it.

There are 2 floats making the duck visible to the dog in the water. It floats on top of the water, and there are plenty of places for the dog to grab the duck with her mouth. The orange beak has a squeaker. I would recommend this for any dog loves to fetch while swimming!",5,OR

"Awesome High Power LED's! I tried one of these next to my TorchStar 4w MR16 LEDS to compare and they are definitely brighter, but have the same great crisp white color. I was replacing 50w Halogens in my kitchen and you can't go wrong with the power savings of these bulbs (6w vs 50w), plus these Lohas 6w are just as bright as the old halogens. Fit and install is identical and they give off little to no heat unlike the halogens which are practically burning up in there. Ordered one more of these for a single over-sink location. I would highly recommend either these or the TorchStar's, just depends if you need the extra light, but either way mix and match and enjoy great energy savings! A+++",5,OR
Reliable and stylish. It toasts evenly and has various settings for different preferences. The retro design adds a nice touch to the kitchen. A bit bulky but worth the counter space.,4,OR

"Not going to lie, I got these for my pregnant self to have a comfy option trig the summer.  I am 5'6"" and 140, these fit nicely under my bump with lots of growing room.

"Providing ample storage at a reasonable price, this hard drive is good for backups but disappointing in terms of performance. Transfer speeds are quite slow, especially when handling large files. It's compact and easy to carry, but the sluggish performance detracts from its overall value. It's okay for occasional backups, but not ideal for regular use.",3,OR

"I have foot problems, so it is hard to find shoes that I can wear all day.  After being on a treadmill for an hour, I put these on for the rest of the day and went shopping, and was on my feet all day with the Grandkids, my feet never bothered me.  This is what I was expecting since I wear a different style of Haflinger as a house shoe and have never had problems.  I wear Chaco in the summer, but start to have problems when winter comes and I have to start wearing real shoes.  I have spent a lot of money on good brands and still have problems, so I am delighted that Haflinger has shoes I can wear outside the house.  I am a little worried about getting them wet, but I guess I'll deal with that when the time comes.  I will probably be buying another pair for outdoors again soon.  Best shoe I have found for all around comfort and support!",5,OR

"My godson and his brother partied to this DVD for about a week then grew tired with the corny music and hum-drum routines. Some of the dance moves are mature and suggestive but most children will have no idea about the steps they'll just innocently follow along.  I'm not certain whether or not this is a good thing. If I'd had the opportunity to preview this DVD I definitely would not have purchased it however, since I did buy it I can say that it was worth the money for the few days of rest it afforded my friend and her husband.  The more I think about it they might have simply played the video of their wedding reception for free and gotten a better response from the boys.",3,CG

"I was into it and yeah, Bruce Willis was not the actor for that role. He wasn't up to it, it wasn't a good fit he phoned it in. Take your pick and yeah it took me out of it. Then the scene where he was being escorted out and the gunmen showed...completely out of character  and didn't match any other time they met resistance. Ruined it right there.",3,CG

I had to order this last min for some upcoming travel.
